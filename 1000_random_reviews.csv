They had 2 tables with printers on display and around the outside of the table were small sheets of paper advertising printers that were available, but not on display.  I picked up one of those sheets, took it to a salesman and told him I was wanting to purchase it.  He said he would go to the storeroom and be right back.  A few minutes later, he came back empty handed and informed me that the printer was out of stock.  I told him that that was fine and I asked when they will be getting more of them.  He then told me that, for some reason, they were not going to be getting any more of them.  He asked me to follow him back to where I got the sheet off the table and showed me a similar printer that was $50.00 more.  I told him that I wasn't interested in that one and said I would keep looking.  As I started to walk away, the salesman took the sheet of paper I gave him, and put it back in its location on the table.  Why would he do that, after just telling me that they didn't have the printer and were never going to have it again?  Again....bait and switch.  I will never be back.",1,EnSUGj7a7FocW3blBj_hEw

At the entrance there is a fish tank under the floor... and that was the best thing about this place... We ordered the Yakiniku and the Hew Do Bow. 

The Yakiniku's stir-fried Asian vegetables were ok, I couldn't really tell with the whole meal being drowned in Korean Soy Sauce.

The Hew Do Bo should be renamed to the Edgar Allan Poe*, because this meal was worthy of being buried under the floorboards and it left me with feelings of regret. 

If I were invited into Stingray Sushi again, I would not venture too far from just eating Sushi...

The second time, well, I will probably never come back. I came here a few days ago to meet with a girlfriend. I arrived early and waited to get a spot at the bar to order myself a drink. I stood there at least 15 min trying to get one of the 3 female bartenders attention (Mind you, they weren't busy). Finally the one guy bartender let me know he would be with me shortly. Unfortunately 10 more minutes passed, so I left and took my business else-where.

I finally had to ask her if she had any hard cider on tap, as she had ignored me up until then.  She was nice enough, but was more interested in Space Jam than a hungry and thirsty patron.  
The Fish Sandwich was the worst I have ever had.  It started out good but I found that it wasn't cod,  but some sort of bottom feeder like Basa, Swai, Tilapia or catfish.  Had some tasty white meat and then that mealy, earthy, slightly unpleasant taste of a cheap substitute for Cod.

Gave me a quote in a few minutes and set up my appointment. Tech replaced the bad part and I received texts on the quote. I approved and Carter called back for the payment details. I got home and verified the replacement part was installed and fired up the vehicle. All is well! Back on the road thanks to AAR with only a minor dent to the wallet.

I'm writing this revew on behalf of my family. Haha. We go to Vegas pretty much every  Christmas break (excluding last year). This year, we had three straight buffet meals: dinner at Bacchanal Buffet, breakfast/brunch at MGM buffet (we were staying at MGM so we got meal credit), and dinner at The Wicked Spoon at the Cosmopolitan (amazing!!!) 

This buffet, which re-opened in September, copies the original concept from The Wicked Spoon in which there are individual, warmed plates of food that you grab. The location is vast, fitting 600 seats and the decor modern and sleek. 

The seafood here was really good. The oysters were so fresh (from Virginia). My mom and I rarely eat oysters at buffets because of being wary of food-born illness, etc. (or oysters, period, considering how expensive they are) but we thoroughly enjoyed slurping on them here. Yum. There were also snow crabs and king crabs. You could also get them hot or cold, which were nice options, although the line system and organization for them was a bit awkward.

The other food was forgettable to me, but solid. I had to look back at my photos just now to remember what I had that was notably good. There was nothing in particular, which might be expected at a buffet. But, I do remember more of my Wicked Spoon meal even if it was later.

The desserts were a feast for the eyes, but by the time I got to them, my stomach felt so heavy -- I had been deprived for too long as a NYC grad student. Hah. I did still try some small bites from several desserts though, and I think I did end up being underwhelmed with the tastes. The mochi ice cream is from Mikawaya, which is good, but I somehow didn't imagine their green tea to be so floral and ""western tea"" tasting...unless the green tea flavor in particular wasn't from Mikawaya? There were two creme brulee options -- the standard vanilla creme and a chocolate one! Both were delicious with good texture and consistency in creme and glazed sugar -- not soggy or mushy, etc.

The price at ~$45 for a weekday dinner (versus $50 for Friday - Sunday) is expensive, but seems to be a common price for Vegas buffets these days. I'm not sure if it deserves its ""#1 Vegas buffet"" from USA Today, but I'm open to going back to the buffet for its setting and various, solid options.",0,JjDQj-lLr-QCL9PQZ3FMcw

A perfect afternoon in Toronto Don't miss Casa Loma

Arrived midday and stayed for well over 3 hours . Wife and I split a wrap in the cafeteria here which was actually tasty and avoids stopping for lunch somewhere else when time is short on vacations. A wait to get in so if you have the city pass or advance tickets to skip the line this I would suggest. Then we picked up the audio tour ( free with admission) and spent the after noon visiting. Its a really well done audio tour and we learned not only about the house and the owner but about toronto as well. We could easily have visited another hour and 1/2. Audio Tours are in multiple languages 8? so pretty good chance you are covered.
Great views over the city and so much history. I realy put this as a must see. I think having this as the afternoon part of our day made sense lunch ( and places to sit if you get tired). Also if weather is bad even a better choice but had advance tickets as wait is outside.
No doubt why its a toronto wedding venue and it was fun to see a bride being photographed wile we were visiting,

I don't think it qualifies as a ""Supercenter"" because it lacks a McDonald's and a bank and a vision department and all that. But I was pleased to be able to have an alternative for grocery shopping in the neighborhood.

After some growing pains experienced in their inventory, they finally started carrying the Yakult probiotic beverage in their dairy section. I drink this stuff daily to stay regular (become friends with your intestinal flora, I say), and have been miffed to find that it sells for $3 a six-pack. But this Wal-Mart carries the cheap, Mexican alternative Bio Salud for 88 cents a six pack!

But allow me to climb down from my gastrointestinal soapbox... The groceries at this Wal-Mart are not always the best quality (e.g. the bacon I purchased was quite fatty, and the shredded Parmesan was less flavorful than most), but you can find some bargains here. And then there's always the rest of the store to explore for those random items you never knew you needed.",2,tFTU5yWOCQLqJMs2YhAaFQ

The delivery boy didn't even have a pen on him so I had to search for one in my apartment to sign my receipt since I paid with a CC over the phone.  And of course, as expected, when I opened the bag of food, it was all cold and soggy and gross. I microwaved it to heat it up and try to salvage it. Took one bite of my mozz sticks- cheese was hard as a rock. I gave up on that and moved on to my cheese steak sub and I wouldn't say it was HORRIBLE but it certainly wasn't good by any means and the whole entire sub was just peppers, onions, and what tasted like fake cheese with a few scattered pieces of meat......

A little over 7 months ago, I took my car to get a rear brake checked and the front wheel, which appeared, be loose. I also asked them to check out the work done by the previous transmission repair, due to having issues with the work the other shop performed and I wanted a 2nd opinion. I dropped it off and waited for their call for the outcome of their diagnosis.  The manager called me and told me the rotors needed resurfacing, the pads needed to be replaced, the power steering pump needed to be flushed, and the booster pump needed to be replaced. He told me the total price ($1,100+) I authorized the work and it was done the same day.  I went to pick it up and discussed the work they did as well as what their opinion of the previous work done by the other shop. They also indicated other items of concern that they found and we discussed this impact of those items. They told me the loose front wheel was normal for this vehicle. So now, 7 months and 8000 miles, later the rear brake is grinding, same one they fixed previously and the front wheel is worse. I took the car back to them based on their written warranty for ""Lifetime Brake Warranty"" and had them check it out. The results were the emergency brake caused the pads to contact the rotor and now the rotor and pads are shot and needing to be replaced. I do not use the e-brake so not sure how or why this happened. However, it is still my problem due to the e-brake was not something they repaired.   They also stated the power steering pump is leaking and they will repair and charge me for another flush. The cost to do all this work was around $800 and the warranty does not cover ANY of the new work.  Here is my heartburn. They previously charged me $96.15 each or $192.00 for both to resurface two rotors, new rotors cost approx. $58.00 each. I checked other shops and they charge around $20 to resurface rotors. The cost for the brake booster was $377 and the most expensive I can find is $183.00. They worked on the power steering pump and now it leaks, but I have to pay to repair it. As for the front wheel being loose, now they say the bearings are bad and needs to be replaced. Lastly, one of the previous items of concern from 7 months ago was the rear shocks were leaking.  Since then, both shocks had been replaced and have a lifetime warranty . .not sure why or how this occurred. I realize now that I initially should have asked for an itemized cost of each line item, but I trusted them based on the reviews I had read and thought it was not needed and they were honest and fair . .lessons learned. I realize they have to make money to stay in business but I would think a fair and reasonable profit on parts (50%) would be acceptable, so as they say ""buyer beware"".

We had been in Vegas for four nights and were looking for something other than the options around our hotel.  I found the Egg & I using my awesome Yelp iPhone app.  Everyone agreed to give it a shot and we were all singing praises to both Egg & I and to Yelp at the end of the meal.

The special of the day was the Prime Rib Skillet, Prime Rib over breakfast potatoes, cheese, and eggs any way you want em.  Two people at our table of six went for the special.  Other meals included a Brad's Scramble, two Chicken Fried Steak Skillets, and mine was the Kay's Omelette (Four egg spinach omelette stuffed with a blend of artichoke hearts, swiss cheese, parmesan, garlic and cream cheese. Topped with fresh tomatoes and feta cheese.)  Everyone was raving about their breakfast, except for one.

One friend does not like mushrooms and did not realize they were in her skillet.  She started to pick them out and when the waitress same to check on us, she noticed the pile of mushrooms and offered to have them remake the dish.  Very nice customer service.  My friend didn't want to wait, so she declined, but it was still very nice of the server to notice and offer a new dish.

The standout of the meal was the breakfast potatoes with their special seasoning.  These are the best breakfast potatoes that I have ever had, and I love breakfast potatoes!  The seasoning had a really good flavor and the potatoes were in the perfect bite-sized chunks.

There are plenty of great reviews for this place, so I don't need to go on and on.  Just one more final thought.  When I am coming home from a trip I always like to look back and think about what I learned during the trip.  On this trip, I learned a few things . . .

So much so that while the Eastern location which is closest to me is closed down in preparation of a new location opening soon, I drove all the way to this location instead of just settling for the Chipotle down the street.   That's partially not true as I was somewhat in the area before deciding to get some take-out for lunch, but it was definitely much less convenient than going the Chipotle route and dammit I still took it.

This location seemed much nicer aesthetically than any other Zaba's I've been to.   That's not to say that they usually aren't nice because they are, but something about this one just seemed a step ahead.   It was packed for lunch but the employees were on top of their game in within a few minutes I was out the door with a couple Zaba Bowls to go.   

I did my usual, a zaba bowl with brown rice, shredded beef, corn, green salsa, and lettuce.   It's about as healthy a meal I can put together at any of these fresh-mex joints that I can still enjoy.   I found it to be a good version of the same thing I've gotten 100 times at the Eastern location.   The shredded beef was nicely spiced (I've had it on occasion lack spiciness which I believe is due to it not being stewed long enough to soak it all in) and the veggies were fresh and as tasty as veggies can be.   My rice was a little mushier than I normally like it, so that was my only minor gripe.   I also shared a bag of chips and they were spot on as usual.   

A good value became even better recently with the introduction of the Zaba's reward card with which every 10 entrees purchased you get the 11th free.   Points are doubled on Sundays.   Since I go to the other location at least 2-3 times a week and buy for 2, I average a free entree every 2-3 weeks.   WHAT HAS CHIPOTLE DONE FOR ME LATELY?   Exactly.",1,v3YOx9T4jRSw8XP9Rd9H4g

Everything seemed to taste off and actually not authentic even though made by asians. 
The chicken feet had a soapy after taste and the cuttlefish had no flavour, just super fishy and smelt like bleach.
The worst part was that the beef ho fun was SO BURNT. Took two bites and left it there. The old lady waiter asked us if we wanted a takeout box but it was so unedible we said no. We didn't want to cause any trouble since she was so nice from the beginning. However she asked if it tasted okay, and we told her it was burnt after we paid.

Canyon Ridge is HUGE, but don't let the size intimidate you. They take the sign seriously: ""Come as you are."" In fact, I feel a bit awkward when I show up in what my parents taught me were church clothes. Really... shorts, a T-shirt, and flip flops are fine... even when I'm serving communion. God sees me everywhere so why should I try to fool Him on Saturday nights or Sunday mornings.

In addition to Big Church (affectionately called by the young ones in the congregation), Canyon Ridge offers myriad options for meeting the Master King. There's the gargantuan building for kids where little old ladies rock your infants, (responsible) teenagers get down on the floor and play with toddlers (under the guidance of adults), elementary kids learn about Jesus while having fun, and middle schoolers party their way through their own services after games of foosball. High schoolers get special treatment since they're a different breed. They have their own service on Sunday nights (since they're all so busy with school, football games, and e-sports the rest of the time) followed by small group time where they get down-and-dirty talking about things that really matter (and things they wouldn't dare talk about with their parents). There are church camps and mission trips (imagine sending YOUR kid to Mexico over spring break to serve God while you enjoy that second honeymoon with your spouse!). For those battling hang-ups, there's the Friday night Celebration service. And, if that's not enough, there's even a traditional service my parents might enjoy!

One of the main things encouraged by the Church is involvement in small groups. Because it's such a big congregation and services are even larger than Texas high school football games, it's hard to get to know people at church. Instead, we congregates congregate outside the congregation so we can ""live life together"" in personal and authentic ways. Canyon Ridge makes it easy to find a small group and get started.

Beyond churchy stuff, there are also the ministries. Most of us serve in one ministry or another. It can mean helping in the parking lot, loving on kids in Base Camp, or helping make copies. Or, it can mean helping organize a snowmobile or ATV adventure for the men's ministry, taking pictures of families as they build pseudo-gingerbread houses, and manning the cotton candy machine at a family event. Seriously... my family's done all of this--and called it ""serving the Lord."" There's also the cupcake ministry where women take cupcakes to strip clubs to show love and respect to those who sometimes have limited life choices. And, I serve in the prison ministry. We take about 100 donated children's books to the women's prison once a month. Incarcerated moms choose a book for their child(ren) and we record their voices as they read them aloud. We then send the books and CDs to their kids who receive gifts from their moms that their moms couldn't otherwise send. Plus, moms give their children encouragement to become strong readers. It's pretty awesome.

I love my church and how it's taught me to experience God in a personal way and welcome you to come check us out.",3,7hlF-dR-m-e8nFZMWao8cQ

I was surprised by how not crowded it was on Saturday before the game. Also, the most vocal fans were the table of Mets fans sitting on the patio (I was wearing my Mets hat), so we cheered with them for a minute before going inside.  When we walked in there were less than a handful of people at the circular bar and maybe three tables were occupied.  For a game day, service was quick and our server was nice.

I think the food at Coach and Willie's is solid bar food with large portions. TI've had the chicken tenders and fries which is good. The tenders have a very light breading which I appreciate. I've also tried the chicken nachos which were OK...at times I would only get chicken and no chips. I've had better chicken nachos at other sports bars.

During the week, lunchtime service is a mess. Service is slow. Really slow actually. I don't mind taking longer lunches occasionally, but last time I went with five coworkers and we nearly had a two hour lunch at Coach and Willie's. That is much too slow in my opinion! Plus, seperating checks is a nightmare there, so my advice is if you go with a group, just bring cash.

There are plenty of TVs and when my husband and I met for lunch there in March, I asked for the TV closest to us to be turned to the Ohio State Big 10 basketball tournament game which they did willingly. I definitely appreciated it.  However, this past Saturday, did every TV need to be on the Kentucky Derby...and it wasn't even the Derby, it was like the ""red carpet"" event hosted by Molly Sims. Blah, I would have much preferred some baseball.

Coach and Willie's is an easy walk to Chase Field and I believe after Dbacks games, they have a reverse happy hour. I'm not sure I would go back again before a game though. If you go during the week for lunch, be prepared to be there awhile!",3,ZQYNombDho1PYfnEWFZevw

Ever since one of my die-hard-LA-Lakers-fan of an Aunt shared the ""Official Wings of the Los Angeles Lakers"" (funny enough) to my family one day - that was a set of 10 lemon pepper flavored wings - my adventurous side smirked at the idea of experimenting with a few other flavors. Thankfully, this branch is located barely 10 minutes away from where I live so when the opportunity to pick a new flavor presented itself, I went with  'Garlic Parmesan' and 'Hickory Smoked BBQ' Both of which were undeniably tasty. 

My father and I have grown to become huge fans of this place and always opt for the 20 piece wings (that comes with 2 flavor choices) He continues to stick with lemon pepper while I've branched out to Garlic Parmesan...by. a. mile. Not only does the texture make the wing so savory but the garlic really does compliment the parmesan in a way that makes the overall taste so rich, the world converges towards it. 

For $13.19 (+ tax), you can choose to get 15 or 20 pieces (I'd be insane to let an extra 5 pieces pass!) and for an additional $2, you can go for wings only (no mini legs) not that it really matters. There's a drive-thru in case you're in a hurry and the staff is very friendly, not to mention humorous (we joked about how they couldn't pronounce my name) There're seats in the restaurant - not the more spacious, I have to be honest - but other than that, this place gives you all the reason for a stop - great food and great service!

I had made a reservation earlier in the day since the night before we swung by and the wait was well over an hour. We arrived right on time. The 2 reasons why I did not give it 5 stars is the following:
1- you cannot make a rez on the patio
2- the A/C is too high inside! Yes it's scortching hot in vegas right now but food, especially great food, does not like A/C!
Our waiter was great, maybe a smidge too ""buddy like"", but both of us really enjoyed our food, the fact that we could hear each other speaking and the lack of greatly needed sensory overload.

I will say I was disappointed that my shaved ice came out to $14...but I understand why. The fruit shaved ice is typically served with what I'm guessing is vanilla ice cream perhaps? But me trying to be a major FA and be all fancy, decided that I wanted the red bean and fruit combined...thus $14. The size was really good with 2 scoops of ice cream a nice serving of the pat, fresh...yes fresh...strawberries, kiwis, mangos, mochi and more! Not sure of it was worth $14, but I didn't leave complaining at all. If I will say one thing it is that I wish the red bean ice cream was slightly softened a bit. I waited a few minutes before I dug in so that the ice cream would be easier to eat. The fruits were a bit on the sour side as well, but let's face it it is not primo fruit season just quite yet. All in all I'm happy I found a place with Korean shaved ice. I will not be fancy next time and ask them to combine two different types. Let's not fix something that ain't broke. 

I've never tried any of their breads but I have had their matcha cake and it is amazing. The flavored are so good, not too sweet and the green tea flavoring is not overpowering. The cake is also a kind of cream based, and it's...I dare to say...perfect. I'm dying to try their other cakes as well as their breads. Reading the other reviews it doesn't seem like I'll be disappointed at all. 

Atmosphere is great. Very quaint and quiet with two window tables and a larger table in the back. The breads are arranged in the left wall and the counter situated to the right with a small cake display in front of their menus. I went in on a Sunday afternoon so it was quiet except for the owners or managers? When I walked in the door I was greeted by a gleaming baby and I'm a sucker for babies. He was so adorable.

For $37.99 Sun-Thurs, you can enjoy amazing meat cuts such as beef ribs, cheese prime ribs, grilled pineapple, bacon wrapped filet mignon and the list goes on! It is much pricier Fridays and Saturdays as they have weekend only meat cuts but sometimes those meat cuts sneak on the regular weekday menu as a bonus!

Once seated, servers come to your table with several meat cuts and with your mini tongs, you grab however much you can eat or just one piece at a time (don't worry, they do many rounds in case you missed or want to try a favorite again) There is also a buffet area on the side where you can help yourself to appetizers such as pasta, soups and salads.

A lot of people find the price intimidating but it is justified because thinking of places like The Keg, you're already paying around $25 for an 8oz steak and here, it's all you can eat!

Highly highly suggest it and they also have occasional live bands and flamingo dancers!",4,uxKSnOVAoEj4I6X9YhLBlg

I'm not too sure what kefir is, but it's supposed to be super healthy. When it comes to dessert I really don't care if it is healthy or not..as long as it's delicious. I wouldn't be getting dessert if I was trying to make a healthy choice. That being said, I was not expecting anything special after hearing about all the reviews around the word healthy.

I have gone to the Pet Planet listed 3 times and love it!
5150 S Rural Rd Suite 106
Tempe AZ 85282 / 480-897-9790

I went in out of curiousity with my boys one time and the Haley (red head) was so nice. She talked to me about my dog and had suggestions on food and treats. She talked about some products they had and really cared about everything I told her about my baby, Bruno. 

We came back that following Sunday and used their Kiosk and got some good suggestions for our dog. My husband came with me this time and Bruno was with us. There was a blonde lady working there (forgot her name, please don't take it the wrong way, my brain is gone!). She was super nice too. She talked to us and welcomed Bruno. She showed us the self dog wash room and made herself available if we had any questions while we walked around.  

The things I love the most about this place are the staff and selection of products. They have both been so amazing and are happy to answer all questions I have. And the blonde staff member called me today (Sunday, 4/27/14) to see how Bruno was doing and how he liked the samples they gave us. SERIOUSLY! I have NEVER been called by a pet store staff member to see how my dog was doing. (Oh wait, I have been called our trainer, Billie, at PetsMart for follow-up on Bruno's progress.) But that's it! She was happy to hear that we changed his food to a product they sell, Horizon Complete, and he loves it. She told me to come over or call anytime I have a question and hopes to see me and Bruno soon. *jaw drop* Now that's customer service with an A+! 

They have a wide range of natural wholesome dog food and treats from raw to dry/packaged. My dog loves Zukes and Blue treats a lot and Pet Planet has a nice range to choose from. I even noticed their raw food section in the back and am planning on coming back to get Bruno a nice yummy bone as a treat soon.

I've been coming here for a while now and slipped up by going to a salon near my house and after comparing their processes, I had to write the review.
First of all, the salon is huge. Rows and rows of nail stations, plenty of spa pedicure stations and they need it for the incredible amount of business they bring in. I was referred to Polished because all of the industry girls go there because they want their nails to look top notch, and I see why. Its clean, everyone is on the same page, they're extremely organized with their booking process, etc. and are ran like a real professional business.
They have a huge selection of polishes and definitely specialize in the gel process. They remove the gel polish with by filing it down rather than using harsh acetone to soak it off. They're nice and quick. They use a hard gel so nails don't break off.
I CAN GO A FULL MONTH WITH ONLY ONE GEL APPLICATION!!!
The only reason I need to go get my nails redone is because they're just grown out. They don't crack. My nails still look great after 3 weeks and I'm extremely rough on my hands. After going to the other salon, 3 of my long natural nails cracked in half!!! I swore that I would never go anywhere but Polished Nails again. 
If you're considering trying this nail salon out, take my word and just book the appointment. You won't be sorry. All the ladies/men I've ever had work on my nails here have been great.",1,7gSwABACGPVrRvWlO5ORGA

The decor is really well done! Perfect tiki vibe, and some great details like a full-wall shell fountain, jungle print couches, and the requisite paper lanterns. 

Drinks: their house specialties run $11, and generally have at least to shots in them. They have the standards like Hotel Nacional, Mai Tai, and a few more exciting selections involving coffee and cinnamon. Definitely looking forward to exploring their menu. 
I got the Painkiller, and was pleasantly surprised. High quality juice and a stiff pour of rum made for a beach drink that didn't make me feel like a 21 year old college girl at her first bar. 

The music was a nice selection of beach classics, but nothing too strange like we hear late nights at the 'other' tiki bar on the Westside. 

 The place was packed so it was a battle to get to the bar. The bar was well staffed, but each drink has every ingredient measured with a jigger, including the mixers! So the bartenders are just buried trying to put out these drinks. Might want to embrace the free pour and count to get things moving.

I still can't believe we ate there. I feel like I was sweating the entire time. Also, the value proposition was way off. I mean I'm not familiar with this neighborhood but with a flee market across the street, I am assuming it's not super upscale. The pizzas are quite small for the amount they charge. For two people for lunch, we ordered one pizza and 2 non-alcoholic drinks and we walked out paying just under $30 and truth be told, neither one of us were full. We were looking for a dessert stop next.

Don't get me wrong the pizza is gourmet and fresh ingredients with great sauce, made with artisan flare in a brick oven ... but I don't feel like it's worth the special trip on a hot summer day, maybe more worth it on a fall or winter day. Service was friendly though slightly aloof, which is fine. It's hot in that kitchen. I wouldn't be in the mood to chat with anyone if I worked 

Edits: The restaurant responded to my note on prices. I guess for me, in the end, I as a customer judge based on taste. I don't feel as if comparison to Pizza Hut is legit but I'm comparing to my experiences with pizza's that were made in mom and pop's restaurants all over Ohio. While they may not have imported their tomatoes from Italy or sauces from New York, the taste based on grandma's home made recipe made in their rustic brick oven is equally divine. I would happily pay what I paid for a pizza meal but I don't feel like it's a lot to ask to walk out not feeling hungry. 

To be honest, for some reason in this part of Ohio, there really isn't as many offerings for artisan pizza. In contrast, try something in Columbus or Cincinnati and even the chains (Dewey's for example) are really top notch. So who knows, maybe this ok and even competitive in this part of town but I still probably won't be back.",0,9GZjNbVdPgkMy5MKHB0tBQ

The cakes were distracting) was very welcoming and helpful. I got a little excited with it being Valentine's day and got one of every cake they had available. (Caramel, Coffee, Strawberry, Tiramisu, Flan with fruit and Green Tea) They were nice and light. Nothing was extremely sweet, but I wouldn't have minded that either. The lighter taste seemed perfect, though. I also got a cheese bread and curry bread. I'd never tried curry bread before so it was interesting. Not amazing, but still good.

The woman at the counter made sure I wanted each cake when I said ""one of everything"" which I think was nice. She was also pleasant to talk to and made sure that she got me a slice of green tea cake that they didn't have sitting out in the front display. I felt a little bad making her get me each slice, but she was really careful about placing them in the box and I'm so grateful. She was also simultaneously very pleasant to the two guys waiting behind me.

In short: lovely light cakes that aren't too sweet and nicely creamy. Breads are also good. Great service and really pleasant. I'd definitely get one of each cake again.",0,MqO4NGK2yrU52RmEXKCFlA

I had them look it up and called my sister and they couldn't verify any other form of payment. So i ended up paying for all but $10 of the massage. My sisters know they paid for it in full but there was an error somewhere so ME essentially got paid double. They knew we were upset and did absolutely nothing to try and compensate me or make me want to come back there.

We proceeded to order:

Bababurger and fries.  Presentation-wise, looked good.  The bread was extremely dense and was hard to bite through.  We had a hard time cutting it in half with a knife for sharing.  The patty had next to no flavor and the texture was odd when eaten with the hard bread.  

Perogies plate (spicy) - this was better than the bababurger but all you could taste is spice and overwhelms the different stuffings for each one.

The only highlight of the night were the fries as they tasted freshly cut and fried.  However, halfway through we got tired of it; maybe due to our palates being numbed from the food aforementioned.  

Afterwards, we felt really bloated throughout the night going into the next day.  It was quite an uncomfortable feeling and for that reason, there will not be a return visit here.",36,6tbXpUIU6upoeqWNDo9k_A

A friend recommended ASAP. I actually kind of hate talking on the phone to explain plumbing problems (smartphones - good at almost everything except being a phone). ASAP had an online form, so I filled it out and got a call about an hour later. We agreed to a time.

They said they'd show up between 8 and 10 a.m. At 8:15, they called up to say they were on their way. Ten minutes later, the crew of two plumbers was there. They had a look around and really seemed to know exactly what was going on at a glance. By 10, they were done. 

The price seemed reasonable based on my past experiences with plumbers. Both of them were friendly and prompt.

Just guess! Yes, GLUTEN. Add her to the 97% of the population of Toronto who believes they have a gluten allergy while they blithely ingest copious sums of it insidiously through toothpaste and lip gloss.  I was barely nodding my head while she was telling me about her new bird diet and while she was stuffing shards of parboiled broccoli in her mouth, I was doing that rude thing that people do: scrolling through my iphone because she was so boring and my Instagram feed was not.

This is what I found: A plate of donuts from @extrabuttercoffee. Not just like any old Tim Hortons donuts, and don't get me wrong, me love those, I am at half-mast just thinking about them BUT! the Extra Butter donuts looked like they were made with the love of your grandma and glazed with the jizz of the mighty gods. 

That Sunday, my neighbours and I took our convoy all the way from the beach to Roncesvailles. And yes, we have coffee shops in the east end, enough that if you stacked one coffee cup lid on top of another and so on, you would get to the moon and back, 17 coffee shops per capita, 100% predictable: I'll have a grande latte with a gluten-free muffin and let me just plug my laptap here and scroll through Facebook while I pretend to work in my ""coffice.""

Extra Butter Coffee is better than that. It smells like fresh, real baking (butter!!!!) and has a sweet deco-inspired decor that is homey and makes you want to hang and talk. There were 9 of us, we all had various pastries with our coffees, mine was a perfect americano by the way, I drink it straight black so I can judge with purity.

I had two things: 

1. A breakfast pastry that was a croissant-type bed encompassing a perfectly cooked egg which was beyond thrilling. Any time an egg gets cooked into an edible vessel is a culinary feat in my opinion. Take my money! And it was simply delish.

2. A donut, duh, that's what I came for. I wanted to try all of them but I went for the Boston Cream. It's a cakey type chocolate donut glazed with more chocolate and then injected with Boston Cream in the middle. Let's just say we had a moment.

Afterwards, the lot of us went for a constitutional walk on the Roncy. It was one of those freezing cold but sunny days that I normally hate because I think the sun is just mocking us at that point like: ""Come out, it's nice! Let me freeze your tits off, hahahahah!"" But I didn't even care about the trolling sun, the egg and the donut made me that happy.",11,GNTxqWboJe0vVIr1G4lgWA

I think I look pretty normal-ish in my v-neck wool sweater and jeans, but apparently I must look like a bum.  Today I learned my lesson from my second visit and got there around 9 am to beat the crowd.  I was just picking up 2 pastries to go for Eric and me.  I was hoping for the lemon-scented egg bread with lemon curd.  Wasn't there.  The lady in front of me ordered her to go pastries.  Then the cashier decided not to greet me, and then go do other things in the kitchen.  After a long wait, she finally acknowledged me and told me the pastry I liked is sometimes made daily and sometimes not for weeks so I can't count on it ever again, and they do not have lemon curd available.  I ordered a blueberry muffin and croissant from the case.  Instead of just plucking them from the case and putting them in a bag, I had to wait over 10 minutes while they put my order from the case behind real food orders in the restaurant.  That makes no sense...there were 4 people behind the counter, can't they just grab 2 things?

The previous visit I met Jaime W. and Jessie B. for brunch at 10 (bad time idea).  Since in my first review Eric R. and I were told to order from our tables, Jaime and I sat down, but Jessie ordered from the long line which I thought was a to go line.  We sat at a dirty table not bussed from the last eaters, and the waitress told us we had to get in line and could not order from the table.  After waiting almost half an hour we were allowed to order from the table - Jessie got her food already.  I ordered the breakfast burrito and asked for more veggies since I don't eat pork.  It was a flat tortilla with practically nothing in it, not even the potatoes it already comes with!  They waitress said the potatoes on the menu were a TYPO that they wouldn't fix because the menu is set?  Since I asked for veggies to replace meat, shouldn't I have gotten potatoes anyway?  She charged me for everything but Jaime only had a bagel and a muffin and she got the muffin for free because it was dry.

I really liked the ambiance of the inside, I like the bar, the wine bottle display, the tables where everyone munched on regular sized sandwiches and the patio looking at the light rail is pretty sweet.

If I lived around here, it would be an easy ""go to place"" for happy hour w/great beer, wine selection and cheap burgers for the carnies-it has a no nonsense charm that I can't seem to replicate in colour scheme except you could take a hipster and your dad here-and that is pretty rare around Phoenix.

I have a limited palate for American food (being vegetarian, lactose intolerant but willing to eat eggs and some seafood if no meat/cheese free dishes, most American style places mean: fries or salad. Big whoop), but I went for the simple Garden salad w/the side of Garlic Bread and just a water. It was really good. That was it. Am I gonna go out of my way for the garlic bread and garden salad here? Um...no.

The service was just kind of weird. Nice, but sometimes I felt I was having communication breakdowns with all the hosts, servers and the random older owner that ran out w/hot sauce for Mr. K when he was almost done w/his eggs. There were a lot of raised eyebrows exchanged at the table, and I even whispered ""Was I really weird? Did I not make sense?"" and it kept happening. Like a waiter-customer vortex where each party thinks the other one means something else at all times.

We only had apps and desserts but they were all really good (fried pickles were amazing).

And I am both happy and sad to report that my expections were met. 

I got 5 of the best sellers to try and paid a whopping $20 (which I won't mind if I am getting value for my money)! I got 1 of each of the regular ($3.95) and chocolate cannolis($4.95). While the filling is generously piped into and onto the edges of the tube, it felt very thick and lumpy like a flour that was not fully dissolved. It was bland too. The tube itself was a little thick for me, thus giving a heavy crisp like sound as you bite. 

The next I tried is the ""7 layer cookie""($1.13). I thought it was absurd to call it as such as it only has 3 layers and they only counted the filling in between and the thin layer of chocolate on top and on the bottom to make it 7. So now I am puzzled, shall I call any 3 layered cake, 6 layer cake?? I can only imagine the counting they would do if they are to make a crepe cake! Anyway, back to the review, the cookie itself had a texture of an overbaked cake. I am not sure if it was meant that way, it was dry and a bit heavy. I thought it was a cake pretending to be a cookie. The size too is so small, like the ones you would get as free samples. 

Next is the cream puff($2.95). I gotta say that vanilla taste was surely in there, you could even see the black dots (vanilla beans i hope). I liked the taste of the filling and that it is the only thing I liked. The texture was thick, not those shiny glistening vanilla creme filling, but flat thick custard type. The pastry puff was dry like it was sitting in there from yesterday. 

Last one is the Lobster tail($5.50). I must say this is the saving grace of Carlo's Bakery. They gotta push this product to customers! I loved everything about it. The pastry was crispy on the outside, you can see the hardwork of repeatedly kneading and rolling of the dough from the layers of the pastry. The filling was a more refined version of the cream puff filling. Not sure if they use the same filling but the texture on this was better for me. It was silky smooth and oozing as you take a bite. This is the only reason why I am not giving a 1 star rating. 

If there's only 1 thing you could get at Carlo's Bakery, it must be the Lobster Tail!",0,wpQgiDo5NqSoYgNdh8lX8g

At lunch, ask for the special sandwich. Chef John creates imaginative sandwiches, different every day, and always something to die for. Do not expect a cheeseburger on a bun, unless you ask for one. They put together meats, cheeses, and sauces -- served on matching breads, rolls, or wraps -- all chosen to complement each other. I don't know a restaurant in the county that can please taste buds with such variety. Even the BLT is unique and delicious.
Every day, there's a homemade soup, if you wish. Today, I had gazpacho that was better than any I've had in Spain, but you don't need to speak Spanish. Thyme pizza is as good as any in Naples, but you don't have to speak Italian. 
Service is casual, so don't expect tuxedoed waiters. But the same quality cooking would cost you twice as much in downtown Cleveland or Columbus, I'm pretty certain.

Good news for Briggs, I will be back! I quite enjoyed my lunch last week.

The menu caters to both food sharers and non-food sharers. So, if you have friends that aren't into the whole ""let's taste each others food"" thing, there are still plenty of options!

For the record, I'm a sharer.

We shared:
- deviled eggs. They were made with mushrooms and bacon. Such a fun twist on this old-school fave!
- sausage. These were locally-made. They were pretty good, but didn't stand out to me.
- lobster mac'n cheese. So good! I think this was my fave dish. It comes with edamame beans too. It added a bit of crunch to the texture.
- Salmon sliders. Thankfully pretzel buns haven't been overdone yet. I quite enjoyed the pickled cucumber and ""tartare"" mayo on these. Bonus: You can order them by the slider!

Let's start at the beginning.  We pulled around back to where the valet parking attendant was and the first thing that struck me was that in order to get inside from the parking lot you have to walk through the kitchen.  But the kitchen staff was used to it and even said a hearty hello to us as we walked in.  It was refreshing to see such openness in a restaurant; I wish more places pulled this tactic as it certainly set the mood.  And obviously, it got me in the mood to eat as the walking through the kitchen just forced me to smell the beautiful aromas of cooked cow.  I was salivating after the first 10 seconds of visiting this place.

And then the next part of the evening that was unexpected is that they don't allow people to use their cell phones.  Our waitress saw a member of our party on the phone while we were eating our appetizers and she approached him and politely told him that cell phone conversations were not allowed during dinner.  Wow.  How refreshing was that?  I mean, I'm one of the worst offenders of using my cell phone (for texting) during dinner... but to know that I wasn't allowed to lifted a weight off my mind.  Again, this place continued to set the mood.

And then the steak.

Oh

my

God.

If you're an atheist (like myself), the steak is nearly good enough to make you pray and give thanks and praise to the almighty.  If you're a Jew, you might just start to contemplate the second coming of Jesus.  If you're Hindu, you might start to think there's something to this whole monotheism thing.  My point?  It was a purely religious experience eating my bone-in ribeye.  I only managed to eat 1/3rd of it because it was so much and it was still incredible.

If you're in Phoenix, run DO NOT walk to Durant's.  Do not pass go, do not collect $200, just go.  Wow.",8,IkoXyeNTHqpU24dHKmIcrw

NZgNN5SEkKBENAU-1GS6KQ,2,2014-01-14 03:47:08,1,eYaZ8VqBmp5eMm4JAVk-uQ,5,"When I'm thinking about reviewing places rarely does the thought to  review the barber who cuts my hair come to mind. As with most men getting my ears lowered is probably down near the bottom of my priority list. Often times I get my hair cut short not because it's so stylish but because it's low maintenance and I don't have to get it cut for a bit of time. 

Then you go to a barber shop on a whim. I need a cut on the hair, I didn't have time to run to my usual spot, and frankly it's only about a two block walk from the shop. So I sauntered down the street thinking well if it's a women's salon oh well I have to get a hair cut!

So I walk in and I'm immediately greeted by these two small lap dogs that belong to the owners and to be honest they are super affectionate little monsters. The young man behind the reception counter politely greeted me after the little pups did and squeezed me in to have Brandon the owner of the shop clip me up. That's where I was very impressed. Brandon greeted me also asked me kindly to give him a few more minutes before he could seat me for the haircut.

What first struck me with Brandon was that he looks so young which of course added to my trepidation with putting my hair in his hands. I had never been here and now I have a baby face barber coming at me with shears and clippers!!!!

What a true surprise and find Brandon is!!!

He is a consummate professional with that great barber twist... how long has it been since you've sat down in a chair with a real barber who takes pride in his craft (if you're a man). Well he was like Jackson Pollock with his tools of the trade or Evgeni Malkin with a puck screaming towards the net on a break away. In other words an artist with shears and clippers. Not only did he listen to what I wanted but he delivered with panache and suave style!

So to make it even better the salon is split in two with the right side being the barber side for all us guys to be guys and get our hair cut by a smooth criminal with clippers. On the other side is the ladies paradise. After my experience my daughter needed her hair done also. So off to the local barber shop/salon we went.

To say my daughter was skeptical of her dad taking her to where I get my hair cut is an understatement but she was definitely glad she went. She was introduced to Sonoma and again this lovely lady listened intently to my wife and daughter on what they were trying to do with her hair, because as any guy knows, women's hair is a magical journey into the feminine psyche of ""beautiful"". Add to that mix a sixteen year old girl and the stage is set for massive disappointments and tragedies if even one lock falls wrong.

Sonoma not only listened, provided feedback, she has girl talk while working down pat. I watched as my daughter went from a nervous teen worried with the outcome of her hair to being at ease and letting a talented professional ply her craft. Sonoma took her time and delivered in a big way! My daughter felt transformed, strutted like a supermodel on a runway in Milan, and was smiles from ear to ear.

So if you are in downtown Pittsburgh, PA and find yourself in need of a great haircut and style stop by and be wowed by your experience give Brandon or Sonoma a call.",5,5XVGDqn9wdwG4c_T1o0XUw

Environment: It's tiny but family friendly. I recommend Reserving a table ahead of time if you want just more than a snack!

Food: mouth watering! I had the vodka penne and it was delicious! The pasta was cooked perfectly, it wasn't too hard or too soft and it absorbed the sauce that was cooked perfectly as well! Their sweet potato fries that my friend ordered were addicting and my other friend ordered some kind of meat that fell right off the bone! I haven't tried everything on the menu, but from what I've had, I give the food 5 stars!

desserts: You can't go wrong with their frozen hot chocolate! The guys in my group aren't big on sweets, but they absolutely loved the frozen hot chocolate! I've tried two different ones: The original and the double chocolate and they we're both super good, especially on a hot day!

Customer service: The host, the waiter and the bar tender all provided great service and checked up on us to make sure our food was great, our glasses were full and that we were having a great time!

I remember discovering fish creek within my first year here in Canada. As soon as I learned how to ride a bike which was at a late blooming age of 8, I headed off to Fish Creek. I decided to embark on a clueless adventure on a random paved path, assuming that it would only be a short ride. WRONG! I went missing for almost a day, pedalling nonstop in tears. Luckily a kind old couple found me spazzing out by the river and connected me to the park ranger, who gave me a ride back home. What a traumatizing experience, I don't ever want to talk about it again.

Still every corner and area of the park offers unique wonders that often comes with the randomness of nature. They now have park maps that outline the major pathways. I love coming down here for meditative runs and invigorating walks, as well the occasional rollerblade fuelled canine chase.

They have other animals here that aren't domesticated. I have mixed feelings towards said animals:
-Deers are ok unless I'm driving
-Gophers are ok unless I'm on horseback
-And cougars... have been exercising their license to prowl
-I hate bees period.",8,9zEr_yHvIKVQ7m0VDnc7gg

They had a nice assortment of gel colors. The lady was really sweet. Talked to be the whole time and her English was pretty good. Massage wasn't that great but they use some kind of scrub that felt really nice  and then some kind of mint mask stuff that left your legs feeling tingly and fresh along with warm towel wraps. Those were both included in the deluxe pedicure which I believe was 30 bucks (plus a little extra for the gel polish) I ended up deciding last minute to stay for a full set with gel polish. They look gorgeous. Didn't get a hand massage like you do at some places or warm towels but still pretty content with the place. The other techs behind me were all speaking perfect English to their clients. My girl was even stayed about 20 minutes after closing to finish my nails. They had a big tv there as well. Final price was 82 for gel deluxe pedi and full set gel polish nails. So still a little pricey but not out of their mind expensive.

The bread for the sandwiches seems to be baked in-house: it's always fresh and crusty.

I've eaten here on my own dime a zillion times, too, just because it's so close to work.

I'll admit my favourite treat from Merci Mon Ami is their hamburger - it has all the flavour of a home made burger (*very* juicy), and the toppings let you personalize it as you like.

oWEFIvvt_kJCuk2V268XeQ,0,2016-09-24 04:37:12,0,P7IzWGXxYZthF0S96PpD5g,5,"Summit Garden Chinese Cuisine is an authentic Chinese restaurant on Winston Churchill Blvd and Dundas St in Mississauga. They have been in business for about 18 years, and have a reputation for being consistent with their food and service. I can definitely see the reason why they have been a successful for so long, as many of their diners are returnees with their family members. 

Summit Garden Chinese Cuisine's interior was spacious and rather stunning with its ornately decorated Chinese decor. Like several mid-upscale restaurants, Summit Garden has an open dining area that is also available for large parties, weddings, and private parties. The space allows diners to have an enjoyable and comfortable experience without being seated in a cramped space. 

Upon entering, we were welcomed by the hostess and seated at our reserved table. Due to the extensiveness of the menu, we decided to get recommendations from the owner, Kenneth Choi, who chose all of the following items for us to try. The extensive menu consisted of several traditional Chinese dishes, but they do have set meals as well. I would say that the set meals offer more of a value, and is highly recommended if you want to try more items.

We started off with the Peking Duck; one of the most popular menu items at Summit Garden Chinese Cuisine. The Peking Duck was sliced table-side, and served with pancakes, sauce, and scallions as toppings. The pancakes came in a steamer basket with several ingredients as garnishes. The pancakes were rather big, and soft, which went well with the crispy and well-seasoned duck skins. Don't forget to pack the pancake with a piece of scallion and cucumber each to enhance the flavor. This was a great first course, and I was looking forward to the next few courses. 

As seen above, the Peking Duck was served in a traditional two course meal. First out was the duck skins with pancakes, and the second course was duck meat sautÃ©ed with vegetables to be eaten as a salad wrap. The portion was more than enough for two people, and arrived beautifully plated. 

One of the highlights of the night was the lobster, which was served Hong Kong style, where the lobster was fried and seasoned. I love seafood, so the Wok-Fried Jumbo Lobster (2 pounds) was quite an impressive feast. The lobsters at Summit Garden Chinese Cuisine was served Hong Kong style, but they modified it slightly. It wasn't the traditional fried lobster from Hong Kong. Rather, I was told that their version was more of a modified version, as they use deep fried fish as well to create a balance in flavor. The lobster here was not super salty, which I enjoyed! Additionally, the lobster meat was tender and succulent.  

There are some Japanese-inspired dishes on the menu including this Fried Japanese Style Tofu ($11.95). Japanese tofu is a popular Japanese appetizer that is often found in many restaurants and izakayas. Summit Garden Chinese Cuisine's interpretation of the tofu dish was not the traditional style. Rather, they made it their own with a hint of Chinese flavoring in the sweet and savory sauce. The portion was very generous, and the tofu themselves were nice and plump. 

Summit Garden Chinese Cuisine is a lovely Chinese restaurant in Mississauga, and perfect for all occasions. They are open for weekend dim sum, lunch, and dinner 7 days a week.",2,hAi-sBBQF43tQqVMmEqVew

- Poutine - I would pass on this because it is your standard poutine. The fries were really good (we asked for them to be cooked well done)

- Aged cheddar burger - The patty was fresh and crumbly. The house made sauce (which reminded me of big mac sauce) was so tasty. 

- Mushy Peas - Bland, I added a generous amount of salt and bp to it. 

- Bread and Butter Pudding - Crunchy on the top, gooey on the inside (with chocolate and no raisins). This dessert was yummy but next time I'd rather reserve my stomach space for the sticky toffee pudding.

- Eggnog Icecream - Firm, creamy, heavenly, delicious.

I ordered the Detroit Coney Dog (with Kobe hot dog) and the Polish sausage with peppers. The polish sausage was OK-you can find much better polish sausages at any grocery store. The Kobe dog was very good-juicy and flavorful. Everything else about the dog tasted like food-service quality buns, chili, and shredded cheddar cheese. Nothing special there. 

Overall it's a good place for lunch or if you've been drinking (it is located on the Vegas strip). A big critique is that two hot dogs and a drink costs about $20. Although it is located on the strip (tourist prices), you can certainly find much better places to eat for $20, even on the strip. 

My biggest critique is actually the menu. When you walk in the menu is located almost near the ceiling, so everyone is straining their neck to look at it. There's way too many types of hot dogs, each one  coming with a different type of meat for starters. There's Kobe dogs, grilled franks, polish sausage, steamed franks, etc. Then they all have catchy names, and the menu is divided into two sections of hot dogs. It's too much, too confusing. They should keep the menu simpler and make it easier to actually look at.

I almost always get either the Mahi Mahi tacos or the Chicken serrano tacos -- in the tortilla on a bed of cabbage, with CBT's signature yogurt-based sauce, and some queso fresco...yum. My husband always gets the Cabo Fish Tacos, but I prefer my fish unfried. I got a burrito once - nothing to rave about - and the scallops once - tasty - but I'm kind of blown away by the reviews on here who give CBT a one or two-star rating and then confess ""well, I don't like seafood/fish/the central concept"" etc. Why would you go to a place with the word ""fish"" in the name? But anyway....

The corn salsa DOES always end up on the table. Just wipe it up. The real disappointment for me, taste-wise, is the sides. I've had the cucumber salad, the napolitos salad, and th baja rice...all not good at all. My husband always gets the Mexican coleslaw, but I stick to beans/rice (with corn)...definitely the tastiest, in my opinion.

And spending $8 for dinner - excellent. Add in a margarita (starting at $4 for the ""El Cheapo"") and you're all set.",1,TRrqMvwY89UvY3UiaQ7RCQ

I AM SERIOUSLY CONSIDERING CANCELING.
I have my wedding scheduled at the Chapel of Flowers later this year (2012). Its my first wedding and I want it to be special. 
Nice chapel nice grounds, but not a great part of town so I booked during daylight hours :). 
If you want your answer to be NO then this is the chapel for you.
I originally booked a mid-range package and added a 1 hour photo session and custom bouquets. I also wanted the copyrights because when I reviewed photo sessions of other couples earlier in January  - June  and the photos were fabulous!!
I look weekly at the photos to get an idea of what I might like in my photos. 
Lately.. (August) I have been reviewing the photos under view ceremony and photos are just not same quality it was a few months ago.  which is disappointing to me and not sure I want to take that gamble in Las Vegas. LOL
I looked at the website and appears as if there are not as many photographers  as there use to be and some are as young as 20 years old (not much experience). So this may be the reason.
For that reason, I downgraded my photo session to only 30 minutes and decided I wanted to wait to purchase the copyrights because I wanted to see them first.  (Better to pay an extra $200  for copyrights than pay $600 for bad photos)
Let just say customer service has gone downhill since then.
Getting information on flowers is nearly impossible. I guess I was wrong to assume if you want a custom bouquet and are paying $200-$300 for that bouquet, the florist should give you input and maybe suggestions.  But that would be a NO.!! Although I read which flowers are in seaons and have asked them, they have not answered and its been 2 weeks.
dont get a custom bouquet here, because and answer to  a flower question will only still leave you with a question unless you yourself have experience in flower design (Which I do NOT)
Basically if you want red, pink, or white roses with some greenery you're in luck here. But they have definitely made me feel like I'm bothering them with my flower questions.
With that said.. I want my day special and not sure I will find it here.",5,kupiQ8_mbSryRtiKKc5ApQ

Called them and spoke with a nice lady that was able to help me get my lashes how i want them where i came in the next day and got it done she gave me an hour for an adjustment but it still wasnt what i wanted as i couldnt take off the old ones and i am not going to pay more money as i already did and not get what i wanted the first hand. over all with my experience here has changed so much as my lashes fell off with in the week of getting the adjustment and i wasnt going to go back to get  a fill as i know its gonna fall off again after a week of them getting them done. the service here is great but their quality of lashes or glue they use isnt the same anymore from when i first got them done back a few years ago with asia.

It's a new restaurant to the large shops of Beacon Hill, which means it might be a little hard to find.  It's right up there by Swiss Chalet and Montana's.  If you think you're lost and can't find it, just keep driving around, you'll probably get there eventually.

Much like Mongolie Grill you can choose from an assortment of meats, veggies and sauces and watch the chefs prepare it for you.

The food can get a little pricey, since you pay by weight and I often have eyes bigger than my stomach.

A great spot in Downtown Las Vegas to bring the little kids and big kids (adults)! It's a one stop eat with a variety of foodie spots, boutiques & shops to choose from. 

We always hit up Pinches Tacos, Chillspot by SasaSweets - for the shave ice and pops, & the Kettlecorn shop for that fresh made lemonade. There are a lot of tables and chairs to eat & lounge outside. 

There's a playground with a bad ass slide and a fake grass play area for kids with a stage for live music, a few couches, benches and blocks for the kids to build their own creations. 

When you're inside the shops (some are very tiny -- fits 5 customers at most) you can't tell that it's built from shipping containers. Very creative and innovative. 

There's still a lot of restaurants here we have yet to try and look forward to enjoying. 

** Note: I hope they add a misting system throughout the park for the hot summer months. There's a few near the stage, but nothing around the tables outside of restaurants. 

TIP: At 9pm, they kick out the under 21 crowd (even if they're with their parents) and card everyone who wants to stay.",14,825Ol4rTvAZnUyFMke37jA

Frock Shop is a staple in my wardrobe. It is an old house on Central (if coming from Uptown and on Central- once you see Intermezzo you have missed it). There is a beautiful wrap around porch. Once you walk inside- you are greeted with an extremely friendly, red headed lady who makes certain you find what you want. If you are the type of shopper who likes to be alone (like me!)- she will leave you alone. If you are the sort of shopper who enjoys help- she is more than willing to help.

Frock Shop also has men's clothing, accessories (THE SCARVES) and jewelry. There always seems to be an event going on at Frock Shop. Check out her facebook page for more info. We went to one that was a gallery opening (THERE IS ART!). 

This is the sort of store you linger in. Accept the glass of wine. Bring a friend, mother in law, sister, co worker. Sit on the front porch. Enjoy really shopping without the hassle and abrasive lights of the mall and without the stress of shopping online.

Oh- and it is local. I heart local. 

FYI- I'm fairly certain she is not open on Mondays and Tuesdays. Also, this is one of my ""must see"" places for out of town guests",7,aSiDSB43CPHwyE3LACuMvA

To me, the portion and rice almost reminds me of a meal you'd eat for dinner. It's quite heavy for breakfast at 10am, which is when they began serving brunch up until 3pm on Saturdays and Sundays. Although my friend and I were completely starved we actually enjoyed sitting at the bar watching the chefs prepare everyone's dish. There were only 2 chefs but they moved quickly. Every dish was served with rice & beans, tostones (fried plaintain slices) and slaw. The dark purple slaw added so much color to the plate. When you sit by the bar you literally see them prepare each dish, making it increasingly difficult to decide what I wanted. All the items on their menu look and sound so delicious. I had to change my dish twice before I was completely satisfied with my choice. I ended up selecting the Cuban styled-breakfast which the waitress said was a popular item. It came with slow roast pork and poached eggs ($14), while my friend went for my initial pick of pork belly with pineapple glaze and sunny side up eggs ($13). The meat was juicy and tender, simply melted in your mouth. We washed it all down with a cup of Cafe Con Leche ($4), which is a Cuban style of a latte with brown sugar on the bottom. The tostones were our less favourite. It was bland and didn't do much to the meal but added some bready texture. It was too dry. I never tried Cuban food before, and not too sure how authentic it is.

The program is extremely effective when followed strictly. The team of fitness and nutrition experts give you all the tools to succeed. They lay out a meal plan specific to your goals and motivate you to work hard in and out of the gym. The boot camp classes are challenging but extremely fun, and each trainer modifies the class on the fly to fit all fitness levels. I never left a single class disappointed!

My personal goal was to lose 5% body fat (my boyfriend did the program with me and set the same goal). By the end of the third week I had already achieved my goal! The most difficult and important part of the program is training yourself to eat properly, but once you are able to conquer that you will see immediate results. We stuck to the nutrition program rigorously (we only allowed ourselves one cheat day throughout the entire 6 weeks) and we both saw incredible changes. All in all, I lost over 10% body fat and my boyfriend lost almost 9%. That equaled out to 16lbs of fat! I gained at least 4lbs of muscle! 

This program really is the real deal and if you work hard it will definitely pay off! The only ""fine print"" (which they tell you about before you sign up) is that you will have to put a $500 deposit down. This is used as ""bet on yourself"" to give you some added motivation to stay on track and complete the program. Once you achieve your goal, your money is refunded. They also give you a list of four supplements (glutamine, protein, aminos and fish oil) but they are completely optional (though I would recommend them as I definitely saw results).

Imagine how much enjoyment is being had by everyone else!

Every time I come here, the vibe is always high energy whether you are sitting bar-side or at one of the group picnic tables. Large beer steins of Sapporo, cocktails, or sake bottles flowing freely.

The menu is tapas style so come with people you wanna share with. It lets you try a little bit of everything and be excited about that!

I never intend to but always end up having a sake bomb or two before the night finishes. I think it is that chant that draws you in ""SAKE. BOMB! SAKE. BOMB!""

Some of my favourite dishes here on a recent trip were:

1. Takowasabi - octopus marinated in wasabi. Wrap some up in a piece of nori and clear your sinuses.

2. Karaage - classic Japanese fri2ed chicken bites. It's so juicy and tender.

3. Salmon Oshizushi - blowtorched salmon melts the fat just a little bit with some green onion shavings.

4. Nanohana - some greens to compliment all the protein. The bit of earthy bite of the rapini was good.

5. Grilled salmon collar - this was an off-menu special item they had for a promotion. Super fatty part of the fish tucked into the nooks and cranny of the collar bone.

6. Sake bomb - obviously this was going to happen

7. Kinoko bibimbap - super yummy and never tried it with the cheese before.

8. Black sesame ice cream - perfect way to end the meal.

Completely stuffed by the time we edged away from the bar and stood up. Until next time.",1,ulk3n0JW8tWnQ83C7m8z9A

While in the end both have the same purpose - sell you a car, I find the slimy ones just impossible to deal with. After a not so pleasant experience with the slimy type at another dealership in town, I ended up at the Worden-Martin Subaru, which, as I was happy to discover, is run by the friendly kind!

I had a great experience there. I went with the idea of possibly purchasing an Outback, and Kelly, the manager, was very helpful. He was in no way overbearing or pushy (which is the best way to get me to leave a dealership and never come back), but still did a great job at explaining why I should buy one of his cars. 

Sure enough, I was back two days later, and I am now the proud owner of a brand new Subaru... 

Seriously, I was impressed by the quality of the service they offered. They obviously seem to care about customer satisfaction (rather than just increasing their sale volume), and the difference is noticeable. I'll probably go back for service, and hopefully I'll be equally satisfied.",3,o-t-i7nbT5N_cmkCXs5oDQ

Their food is phenomenal, however, their service is the WORST I have ever seen. I live near Tryst and would easily go there every weekend for breakfast and during the week for dinner if they didn't make me feel like scum every time I went there.

My first experience I sat at the bar and got breakfast. Was completely ignored the whole time and never once was asked how anything was and was only talked to to take my order.

The next time, I went for a week night dinner with a friend. Since we were the only one in the restaurant, the service was OK. However, upon reviewing my bank account, Tryst added about $10 more on to the TIP portion of the bill. When I went back to the restaurant and talked to a manager, she said she would take care of it and do whatever it took to fix it, and she took my name and phone number. Well, it never got fixed and I never heard from her again.

This past time this morning when I went in, sat at the bar again to eat breakfast, was not even asked ONE TIME if I wanted to refill my water. The only time I was asked if anything was OK was when my food was brought to me. After I finished my meal, I saw a waitress leaning on the bar and didn't even ask me if I needed anything. I had to ask a blonde waitress and she snarled at me after having an attitude with another coworker right in front of me: ""Well what tables are MINE?!?"" giving her an up and down look.

This place is downright unprofessional, has no class, and I WILL NOT ever return. It's a shame too, because the food is amazing and I would have spent a lot of money there.

Combo Pan Roast

Nose of briny seafood and brandy-sautÃ©ed Holy Trinity (onion, celery, bell pepper).  Rice pilaf had some buttery nose. Earthy and briny holy-trinity-accentuated palate with medium saltiness and vegetable and spices sweetness. A touch of sourness. The flavor was deep and complex. Everything is just balanced. Texture was rich and velvety. Identifiable meat was only a couple of shrimps. They were supposed to be lobster and crab. Gigantic oyster cracker gave a counterbalance of some sesame nose and sweetness as well as a crunchy texture. Very happy. 4.5/5.

We started with the deviled eggs. They used a chipotle sauce which made them taste amazing! I highly recommend them.

Huge selection of fruits and veggies with some of the lowest prices you've ever seen! 50 cents for a package of strawberries, 3 lbs of oranges for a dollar, peppers for 25 cents each! Perfect for anyone who is on a budget or wants to experiment with some veggies that they wouldn't usually use. Sure you can't buy these items and expect them to last several weeks - they are fruits and veggies after all, but at these prices you can just stop by on your way home from work every few days if you wanted! Sometimes you'll have to pick a little through the selection and the prices change almost weekly but that adds to the whole fun, farmers market feel of the place!

3 packs of strawberries - 50c each

The doctor only sees you on the initial visit, then you are passed along to the Nurse Practitioner. The dr/np strictly dispenses medication based on your lab results (which can take weeks) without a discussion about your specific symptoms. When I asked to transfer to another endocrinologist within the same practice (based on neighbor referrals) I was denied that right.  That is absurd!  You would expect the PATIENT to come first, not the doctor's ego, but not in this practice.

I was like ""Have you done it before?"" & she said ""No."" but I signed up for it anyway. At the time, I was doing bootcamp and running 3 miles, 3xs a week. On the day of my first class, I drank about 2 liters of water prior to class to prepare myself. The class itself is miserable. It's hot. It's humid. I hate those combinations. The class is also LONG. As a parent, I hate not being able to put my kids to bed to work out? What? I can go on a run in 30 minutes whenever I want rather than be gone for 2 hours (90 minute class + 30 minute drive there & back). 

The poses are not that difficult. I never had to sit down or stop, or not do a pose. I just think this should be considered lazy yoga. The yoga I'm used to, you're holding yourself in plank for what seems like an eternity until your core is burning, your toes are screaming, and your arms are shaking. Here, you do a pose, then lay down. Do a pose, then stop, lay down. It's just the heat you have to beat. Every class I've been to, I think someone has walked out. There is always someone who sits down at least half the time because they think they're going to die. There is no music. The instructor doesn't do the set with you, she just talks you through it. The room smells so bad. Especially when you're laying in savasana on your stomach. I came to 5 classes within a 2 1/2 week span. It is just not my scene. I want a fast and rapid work out where I feel like I burned a bazillion calories and that my heart is going to burst out of my chest. This is time consuming, and kind of lazy for me.",6,EKEtbkIswDNQqxcy8vy8Kw

My initial impression of the hotel when I walked in was that it looked pretty cool. I loved the ceiling of the casino area. It's quite nice how many details are created to resemble Paris. The check in counter was beautiful with all the chandeliers. 

So why 4 stars and not 5? I felt that the hotel was disorganized in their booking system and this affected the check in process. On the night my party arrived, we went to the express machines at check-in but they weren't working. So we lined up and there weren't many counter representatives so the line was quite long. Can't really complain since I know it's Vegas and other hotels could be just as busy.

My issue with the checkin is because my room was not available ... and I arrived at 11pm which is wayyyy later than the allowed check in time so my room should already be prepared. My room was booked ahead of time online. They did not prepare a room. Why was it not ready? How can a hotel like this be so disorganized? The staff who was checking my party in had to check the system which rooms were available at the price we paid. So we waited ...  then she tells us there is a room available with one king bed. But we booked a room with TWO beds, two queen beds. She said both rooms are about the same price. But it's not about the price. This is about customer needs. We (customers) paid for a room with 2 queen beds. If they overbooked a standard room then they should offer an upgraded room with 2 queen beds, not another room with 1 bed. I'm confused why she thinks we would take that offer when we paid for a room with 2 beds. 

Anyways. She made a call to see if there were any rooms left with two queen beds (which we booked and paid for in advance) and there was. So we got our room finally.

I was disappointed how can Paris hotel not have an available room which was booked and paid for. You would expect their system is accurate and they would not have such issues. 

Other than the horrible check in process, I think the hotel is nice. The housekeeping staff are friendly and they did a great job. I hope they improve on their check in process.",2,eZeBuiVZWT7u3SktO7mv9w

It feels very industrious and it's a large space with a lot of variety in types of seating. It's usually really busy so you should use open table to reserve your name on their waiting list! It saves you a lot of time and grief.

I always 'make my own' burger and have always really enjoyed them. There are so many options and I feel like you really can't go wrong. The ingredients are super fresh and still so the next day if you have left overs. About that... they're pretty large! I get pretty full off of one half. They typically come with a side of chips, which also stay really crispy the next day.

Other than burgers, I've replaced my chips for fries a few times, and I've also tried their milkshakes and onion rings. The milkshakes are very very good! I've tried all except their chocolate one. My two favorite are the smore's one and the caramel pretzel one. And the onion rings are HUGE, like as big as my face! But they're good and filling.

The mac and cheese has always been my go-to, so I decided to try two new things: pear/goat cheese salad with chicken and the antipasto platter.

1) The pear in the salad was rock hard
2) The candied nuts were missing
3) The chicken was so dry it was inedible
4) The tapenade on the antipasto platter tasted rancid - so bad that I felt sick to my stomach

I asked my friends to try everything to see if I was having an off night, but they confirmed: dry chicken and expired tapenade.

I started to explain the salad issues to the waitress and before I could finish, she was gone.

We requested the bill - after being ignored for about 15 minutes - and our waitress asked if we'd like the tapas platter wrapped up. I said no and just pointed out casually that  something was off with the tapenade. I tried to laugh it off a bit, fully realizing how ridiculous I sounded at this point. She said nothing and took the plate away.

When she came back with the Visa machine, she said that it was an olive tapenade (which I knew, given that I ordered it) and that it's supposed to taste ""pickly"". Regardless, they removed the dish from the bill.

I hadn't expected the platter to be comped since I'd picked at other items on the plate. (The salad, on the other hand, was a no-brainer). Either way, the tapenade didn't taste pickly - it tasted like it had gone bad.

With so much restaurant competition in this area, customer service is kind of key. So while I appreciate being comped for the food, a simple apology would have gone a lot further.

 So this was my first time in Vegas since being 13. Came here with my PIC and told him this was the place I knew I wanted to go to since they have a TON of spots to eat within the hotel. Sadly I only ate at two of them LOL. My ass slept most of my Vegas trip actually. 

  Anyway we arrive and go to the front desk. Check in seemed easy breezy. We were on the westside so there wasn't this crazy walk to the elevators.  I wasn't used to the hustle and bustle of getting to it . Anywho we get to the 17th floor and man our  walk to the room was a fuckin long walk! Well the bigger rooms are in the back because when we opened the door it was a nice suite!!!! I loved the large couch with that spot you can stretch your legs and sleep on. We had the his and hers sinks and a jacuzzi! Not the best view (Hooters hotel across the street lol) So it would have been niceto get the view on the side with all the other hotels. No worries, The room was off the hook and the bed was so comfortable. So comfortable, my ass slept more than anything in Vegas. I shit you not I got my rest FOOOOOO SHOOOO! 

I didn't care for any of the gambling. I gambled 6 bucks. I don't get off pressin buttons gettin nothin. Tables scare the shit out of me way to intimidating.  But I enjoyed going to Fat tuesdays about 5 times :D 

I was very comfortable here. I just think next time I need to stay in the middle of the strip because I refused to walk around. I felt like MGM was back of the bus of all the good stuff on the strip.  Oh well I still slept good and I enjoyed that Jacuzzi tub!",3,XY3EtrJI1OLMtiSQVrRZug

The staff are all really knowledgeable about their products and their craft. The drinks that I have ordered (typically espresso based drinks) are quite delicious. If you are a fan of hot chocolate, theirs is the best I've ever tasted.

The atmosphere of the shop is pretty good. If you are planning to sick around, there is a loft upstairs with seating, a few tables on the first floor, a bar area against the window to stand, and bistro tables outside. There is good light from the large windows and good music that help the ambiance. 

Ordering and waiting for your drink gets a bit cramped up because of the layout of the space (and honestly, this is where the shop does not clinch that last star for me). They use a brewing method of pour over, so it seems the drinks take a bit longer to make. Literally every single time I go to 21st Street Coffee, someone grabs my drink from the pickup counter because the ordering/waiting for your drink to come up process is a bit awkward due to the shotgun (i.e. skinny) layout of the shop. What is even more awkward is when you have to explain to your fellow customer that was behind you in line that they just picked up your drink, and since I am admittedly not the most forward person, it is something that I deeply dislike dealing with when trying to relax and get a coffee. Perhaps associating a name with the order would help this process? 

Regardless, it is definitely worth a visit to the 21 Street Coffee and Tea shop for a delicious coffee and you'll be treated with the fruits of labor from real coffee craftsmen.",1,mdaKaPOKte_-7v3REM7Siw

They have had two of my favorite appetizers...maybe 2 of the top 5 or 10 appetizers.  One being their Slow-poached Organic Farm Egg--Smoked Potato/Shaved Black Truffles/Toasted Country Bread.  The other being their famous Foie Gras Custard Brulee--Apricot Chutney/Toasted Cocoa Nibs/Salted Brioche.  If these two weren't enough, Sage continues to shine with other great starters.  The Aged Tequila Mignonette that accompanies the already creamy and succulent Vancouver Island Kushi Oysters is fantastic!  Moreover, the Wagyu Beef Tartare is a solid choice and the Chilled Sweet Corn Soup is outstanding!
 
Additionally though, this cocktail snob can't stop thinking about their ""Seville Constelation."" This is my current favorite drink.  There is nothing I'd rather start an evening of whiskey/bourbon/scotch/rye drinking more than this drink.  It is refined and delicate for a whiskey-based cocktail, but still has enough of a backbone to entice whiskey purists.  It is the epitome of a balanced drink!

The menu is not perfect in my opinion, I have had a few dishes on occasion that have fallen flat, but in general Sage's dishes are inventive, and bring together a wonderful combination of technique and flavor.  I am certainly more of a fan of the Starters then I am of the EntrÃ©es, but that doesn't mean that the EntrÃ©es are bad, just not as euphoric as the Starters.  I generally prefer lighter meats and seafood dishes.  I think Sage does a good job with these items, but I would recommend the Steaks and Braises to those looking for more cohesive plates.

Always check to see if they are participating in Restaurant Week when it rolls around. This year's Restaurant Week menu at Sage was the best value on all of Restaurant Week....it was a delightful excuse to come in again.

Furthermore, Lauren is one of the best servers you will ever have the pleasure of experiencing.  Don't request her though as we are trying to keep that on the DL so she is available for us when we come in.",11,A5A34ixb-yy6nwL42iZsnw

Upon the completion of my trip, Demitiri touched base to schedule a call which I thought was very professional and to be honest unexpected yet very much appreciated.

He handled the conversation in a very professional manner and explained the situation in extreme detail. The fact they were able to have a tough conversation and make things right is all a customer can ask.

They promptly refunded me my deposit on our Rehab experience which again was unexpected but speaks volume to their commitment towards customer service.

It's action like that which makes me comfortable with giving their service another shot. Our group had an amazing time at Marquee, so I've definitely seen the value in their service.

I delivered my son early and wasnt expecting to need a breast pump so soon. I went to the BRU on signal butte in mesa and was told that the pump I saw on my phone was out of stock. They called and checked the availability of the pump at the PHX store and I was told they had it. It was a breast pump by medela regular priced $349.99 on sale online for 269.99$ for that much of a price difference I took the drive. When I arrived I was told by a supposed manager Elsie that I had to pay $349.99 there cause I wasn't buying online. After driving 45 minutes to there I was upset. I explained the situation that I literally was just out the hospital and my 3 day old baby was in the car with my husband. She said fine she will call a manager Tracy and she said  well you can order it online and come back for it. Again I explained that I had driven an hour and just came out the hospital. I explained I couldn't wait for the pump as I needed my
Milk to be expressed. The lady laughed when I asked for a manger and said that. Then she came back an offered to allow me to order online and do in store pick up. That I would wait anywhere between 1-2 hours. At first I said okay but then they said the price would be 349.99 and then they'd give me a coupon for 15% off to offset the online price ??? I'm not a math whiz but they were still trying to
Up charge me after saying they called Darren loff the district manger for permission to price match the online price? When I asked the store manager Tracy to contact Darren so I can directly talk to him myself she said maybe he is busy and I said ok we're all busy I need to not take an hour looking into buying a breast pump...she said well if I call him i might get a voice mail and I said ok but you might not..,so let's just try and call him cause what your saying isn't making any sense. She then said
She would give me his number and gave me a 800 toysrus # and said I can just try and get him there??? I explained that I felt she was trying to hide the situation from upper management and she told me good day andwalked into an office and shut her door. I could not believe a company that supposedly prides themselves as a company that Is for children would treat people like that!! I was crying by the end of this ordeal and in walking out the other person who worked there tried to offer me a lesser quality pump for the same price as the Hugh quality one I wanted and said I might as well get it since I'm still gonna need a pump
Anyways ??? Are they nuts...u don't go into buy something of quality and they say well since I can't get it let me buy a lesser quality for the same price. I can't imagine these women are in management and argued with me in front of multiple customers -- if anyone knows what I can do to properly complain pleae email me @ alinda1313@yahoo -- thanks all",3,gggKV_P1woCX7V1TuYFqhg

we ordered their signature ""sloppi-jo"" ... 
you get two items -
1 --chile pork w/ egg and onions
2 -- flour tortilla

the idea behind the sloppi-jo is to take #1 and put it in #2. 
um... isn't that just a taco w/o cheese??? okay, there's an egg in it, but still. where's the bun in a real sloppy joe? it's not really sloppy at all.. in fact it's all nicely packed in that tortilla.

total is $6. ouch. for that price you could get... what 3 or 4 tacos??? 

we weren't blown away by the taste of it too... pork was way too oily
and the overall taste was ...as another yelper said, ""one dimensional"".

Once inside, the European theme continued and my friend and I spent a few minutes admiring the decor. Menu is relatively extensive and as per the server (who guessed by the touristy look in our eyes that we'd never been before) advised that they are known throughout Ontario for their Wiener Schnitzel.

However, neither of us felt in the mood for that so we continued to explore the menu. I got a pierogi entree which was delicious, no question these are the real deal! Boiled, stuffed with potato and cheese and seasoned to perfection. Amazing!

My friend had Pork n pierogies and had absolutely no complaints. She enjoyed every bite!

Customer service was nice they were friendly and outgoing. The food however, was missing a lot of flavor.

I ordered  coffee and not bad (since I am the pickiest when it comes to coffee). My partner ordered a bacon burger and his too lacked a lot of seasoning.  

They have a small bar once you walk in and also have a patios to sit outdoors. Currently they are remodeling the frys next door so there's a lot of construction in that are (parking can be a hassle)

The staff are courteous if not exactly cheerful, the place is clean and it has a decent waiting area from which you can see inside the shop (could be good if you're watching what's happening to your car, or bad if a visit to the repair shop for you is kinda like going to the dentist - a painful wait to find out just how much money it will cost you). 

With the tire rotation, I just managed to drive back onto Independence when it became clear the car is not driving in a straight line anymore. Back I go: Apparently the tires were worn out in a way that didn't allow for rotating them anymore. They hadn't noticed that before. 

After my 30 dollar oil change, I got a quote for another half dozen repairs that according to them needed to be done and would have totalled close to 1000 dollars. Thankful for the pointers, but since I was having no car trouble, a three page quote of stuff that ""needs"" to be done seems like they're trying hard to squeeze money out of me. Although to be fair, I am no expert on cars, so I can't say too much on how fair their quote was.

The inspection and tire change was fine, except for the wait. They said getting the tires would take 45 minutes. It ended up taking them 1.5 hours, and with changing them, the inspection and various wait times in between, I spent over three hours at the shop. 

Lastly, I am a AAA member, which should give you 10 percent off labor at AAA car care centers. I asked if they needed to see my AAA card, they said no. No discount applied. I had to ask right-out for the discount on the labor costs before they granted it. 

I came here for the credibility and fairness that I hoped the AAA name would guarantee, but I think I'll now give somewhere else a try.",4,up-mcezRNykPU1RvfNFt0w

Of course, they got rid of Tapas and went with a new ""Mexican"" menu...because if there's one thing Las Vegas needs more of in the dining scene it's less diversity and more Mexican food. Everything sounded great, but every single thing we ate felt like it was missing one ingredient. They tried to get all ""artsy-fartsy"" with the menu and it turned into SWING AND A MISS. 

The first batch of chips we had was not just ""salty"" it was more like OH MY GOD, HOW CAN ANY HUMAN BEING PUT AN ENTIRE ROMAN CENTURION MONTH'S WORTH OF SALT ON ONE BASKET OF CHIPS?!?!?

5* food, 5* service and 5* decor.

Thank you, Kenny, for helping me out with my numerous special requests.

Monday night, we enjoyed a half priced bottle of wine: Super Tuscan Luce Della Vite Lucente 2013, a Merlot/Sangiovese.

I highly recommend the smoked salmon bruschetta.  The other bruschettas I tried (brie/apples, tomatillo and Mediterranean) were fine but not as WOW as the salmon.

I loved the spinach salad with strawberries, goat cheese, granola. Best part was the orange &apricot vinaigrette, which I ordered on the side.  Best dressing I've had in a while.  I did hold the fried parsnips that were supposed to come with the salad.

The cheese plate is exceptional.  Comes with grapes, olives and other goodies. The blue cheese was my favorite.

Dessert menu could use an overhaul.  The gluten-free biscuit that comes with the peach cobbler is so vile, I wouldn't want to have it even if I needed GF.  To be fair, the waitress Jennifer was trying to hint that if I'm not GF, I might want to try a different dessert.  But I wasn't expecting the biscuit to be THAT bad.  The peach part of the cobbler is delicious.  Why can't they offer it with a normal crumb topping for the rest of us who don't need GF?  And wouldn't the GF diners prefer small crumbs of the GF topping rather than the huge, dry biscuit?

My criticism of the bread pudding is entirely unfair, since I ordered the ice cream in a separate bowl and it probably would have been fine with the ice cream dumped on top. However, it still would probably be better if the bread pudding had raisins or pineapple chunks (or both!) for both flavor and texture.  Without the ice cream, the bread pudding definitely needed something. Hey, this is Wisconsin and they serve everything with dairy and dairy with everything.",0,bKVoDedXW_B6i4-lL6-YDQ

*advice below*
the tour is about two hours for all 21 stops, including a 15 minute break at stop #15 *not sure if this is status quo for every bus ride*
hop on and hop off is a beautiful thing if you use it :) 
buy the ticket online, save a couple bucks 
get on the tour early in the morning, same with the boat ride
bring a camera with charged batteries
sitting at the front of the upper lever will provide excellent protection from the wind caused by movement
if you can...on the bus they offer discounted tickets to all sorts of attractions, that tie into the stops on the tour. you can buy them for the day of the tour, or keep them till the end of the year.
if you want a restaurant recommendation, they usually have one at every neighborhood. 
don't be afraid to ask questions 
have fun and enjoy yourself, its a great tour, even if some previous people think its expensive, its really not, IF you can take advantage of the boat tour

from a photographers stand point, bring a decent camera, sometimes the bus stops at lights you have some time to stand up and get a couple of shots in, it doesn't always happen, but when it does its brilliant. the boat is amazing, and might be one of the best parts of the tour. 

out of this whole day of tourist-y fun, my only complaint: 
out of 21 stops, but if no one is getting on or off, they do not stop, would have been a bit nicer if they did a minute break at each stop, to stand and get better photos.

My first time there was phenomenal. The hostess was super nice and because we got a seat by the bar, we chatted with her most of the time. The patrons and bartenders were also pretty friendly, and it was honestly the best time I've had at a restaurant in a long time. 
I tried the eggs Benny with beef patties. It was delicious. Hollandaise was creamy. The eggs were poached perfectly and the parties were hands down, the best I've ever had.  Why? The filling was all beef. Super delicious! 
Dave got the chicken and waffles. He loves the white sauce that comes with it. The chicken is lightly breaded and cooked crisp on the outside, moist on the inside. Packed with flavor. The waffles are broken into bite sized peices, ideal for dunking, ideal for eating the entire meal with your hands, as he did. 
I tried the Cesar made with jerk seasoning. Dave got the coconut jelly with a shot of Appleton. 
Everything was yummy.

The second time around was on the anniversary brunch event. They had steel drums and a few complimentary items like a toasted corn with coconut creme and a rum soaked watermelon. 
Both were good. I will probably try to replicate at home.
We had the same entrees as before but for dessert we tried the cookie butter french toast. Not too sweet and not dense like some places. Even Dave enjoyed it and he never goes for french toast. 
Drinks I tried the mimosa made guava juice- yum! Dave had the trade wine which tasted like liquid candy.

Curry used to be a golden standard here, but it doesn't taste as good as I remember since the potaties are a bit harder and the meat less tender than before. There was a time when I'd order two dishes for myself here every visit: one curry, and something else to try*. It's not on that level anymore, but still a spot for a fast meal.

What I'd Get Next: Malaysian curry with beef brisket
*The fried noodles and the porkchops were AMAZING, but I haven't gotten them in a couple years now.

Their curry roti is more expensive than their curry rice... And the roti is real good, but is literally two (maybe three) bite-sized.

On 8/4/2015 at around 3PM I arrived for an hour and a half massage.  I initially did not know the name of the person who massaged me- but I won't forget the experience. The massage was mediocre at best. After I paid using my debit card the massage therapist had the nerve to insult my $10 tip saying that it wasn't enough for a person as big as me!!

I told her it was all I had in cash (and she did this in front of other clients who were walking in to see if she could pressure me into more cash)... 

I have referred many of my friends to this place and brought people with me for more than three years. I'm completely insulted and incensed by this behavior. What I failed to do is take back the $10- but be sure I'll be calling to complain. 

I find that; unprofessional, completely rude and there's a good chance I will never return here!!

To add insult to injury I notice on my frequent massage card that the date was backdated to yesterday!!  I guess this woman did this with the hopes that if I complain she wouldn't get caught!!

It took her like 45 seconds to date and sign off on the card and she look like she was thinking about not doing it!!

I'm calling to complain to the manager listed on this yelp page but I doubt I'll see any satisfaction!

Today is August 4 and I went in at around 3 PM.

After a lenghty, well put together E-mail to: jackpotfootmassage@yahoo.com ATTN: YoYo (the Manager referenced on this Yelp Ad) the email was returned AND the yahoo email address on the Info page is not active!!

I then returned to the establishment and a woman who identified herself as ""Judy"" refused to contact her manager and said their was no one named YoYo.  (""Judy"" is the rude massage therapist who continued to insult me!)  She said there was NO MANAGER. 

She also said that tipping was 20 to 30% of the total bill for all patrons!!!  She added that her job didn't pay her enough and so that is why she had to insist on 20-30% of the bill in cash gratuity!  When I pointed out that tipping is OPTIONAL and not MANDATORY - she stuck to her story ""That we expect 20-30% as tip"" - smiling in my face and mocking me!!!!

When I phoned a few moments later ""Judy"" answered the phone and also refused to be of any assistance.  She hung up on me!

Very average Chinese place. My girlfriend and I have been searching around for good Chinese places and this place was fairly close to where we now live.

I placed an order over the phone for General Tso's Chicken and Orange Chicken meals (which come with fried rice, an egg roll, and a fortune cookie). When placing the order, the woman on the phone seemed overly rushed, but she took my order and phone number. After receiving those, she hung up. I never said my name, and I never was given a time to come pick up my order.

I decided to just head from my place to China Wok and see if it was ready. On arrival, I know now why she seemed so rushed, she was practically working alone. She asked if I had ordered the General Tso and Orange Chicken, I said yes and was given a 5 minute wait time. I picked out a few drinks from their fridge, paid, and found a place to sit.

It wasn't long before my order was ready, service seemed more polite than it was over the phone. I left and brought the food back to my apartment.

My girlfriend and I opened our food, which was labeled so we could tell our orders apart, and gave it a try. The rice was phenomenal, the eggrolls were large, and the chicken was well sauced. The chicken was lacking in flavor as the General Tso's Chicken was not very spicy (dispite having hot peppers on the menu picture), and the Orange Chicken was not very sweet. 

Serving size was nice and filling, price was pretty standard for Chinese, service over the phone was not very good (but much better in person), plenty of sauce.

The only reason I wouldn't give it a 4 star rating would be because the chicken was not to my standard in flavor, and the service over the phone was pretty rough.",0,v3z7hZNGkk7IlHasnSXYRA

My friends and I initially saw this place in passing one night driving down Hualapai and anytime I see a Hawaiian named place I get curious (I'm from Hawaii so I can't help it). So we made it back one Friday night and were very pleasantly surprised by pretty much everything. 

The establishment was clean and they let us pick our table -- so we sat ""under the stars"" in this cornered off section towards the back of the restaurant. Pretty cool concept. 

Ok, so this place has Happy Hour ALL DAY on Friday and Saturday which is half off all sushi. Big A+++ in my book! We ordered pupu style (to share) the Lisa Lisa roll, Alaskan roll, spicy lobster roll (my favorite of the night) and the Hawaiian calamari (one of the BEST calamari I've had to date!) 

Our server was AWESOME. Super friendly and very attentive and helpful. I wish I could recall her name... Nina?  Something like that lol. 

Their menu is pretty impressive. Aside from their sushi rolls, they have a variety of appetizers and Hawaiian style food (plate lunches), which I want to make my way back for to try. They also have an all you can eat sushi menu.

Fantastic place for a weekend lunch (adults $16) or a special occasion dinner. The buffet selection is excellent. Nigiri is good; excellent cuts of salmon if you choose carefully. Only other options are avocado, crab stick and shrimp. Rolls are good too and are pretty much standard North American sushi fare: california, spicy salmon, tempura shrimp and a few others. They don't overdo it on the rice and everything is fresh and good. No sashimi for lunch but if you eye the white tuna long enough and are polite, the sushi chef might just break you off a piece or two. 

The buffet is a little awkward in its layout which is only really a problem when it's busy... which it was on our visit. However, throughout the restaurant are different stations: a hand-roll (temaki) station, a fish ball soup station, a grill station, tepanyaki station, carving station etc. to ensure everyone gets what they want.

On my first trip around the buffet I loaded up on tempura. The shrimp was excellent. When I went back for one more piece I was disappointed to find that it was now the frozen, pre-made battered golden fried shrimp which is standard at any Asian buffet and was left wondering where the good stuff went. The tempura was light and fresh, unlike at other buffets I've tried where it's doughy and heavy. The tempura included stuff like taro, yam, squash and so on. None of the onion rings masquerading as tempura or battered, deep fried broccoli of some other buffets.

All in all, $60 for three people well spent. Senior's discount and kids' pricing too, which is nice.",3,ndUy9YVtQ0v-DFCk8wKu9w

It was all inclusive but from what I experienced that means crap customer service. Even before the wedding day, Victoria's told the bride she couldn't have a food tasting. She could come on the day of an event and taste whatever they happened to be serving on that day. They also said that they wouldn't do a rehearsal because no one pays attention.

The day of the wedding we arrive and guess what? They want us to do a small rehearsal. We were there early before the other guests arrived and waited around for awhile. When they asked us to rehearse, we thought we would just line up in the lobby and practice walking with our partner. We thought wrong. They took us into the chapel, where all the guests were sitting and waiting for the wedding to begin. Just imagine how awkward it was for the bridal party to line up in front of all the guests for practice. (Don't worry guests, this isn't the real deal). 

Our interactions with the house photographer were also horrible. There was some time between the wedding and the reception so guess what (again)? We took photos in front of the guests. We then went outside for some additional photos. The bride asked that the photog take some very specific photos, which he was not happy about. He gave her a bunch of attitude and was plain rude about it. The bride and groom's attendant then tried to rush the bridal party inside so the photog could get pics of just the bride and groom all the while the bride is telling them she wants more pics with the party.

The party was directed inside to mingle with the guests at the reception. Ten minutes later we're told there are more pictures to be taken. Great!

Among other issues:  the wrong music played as the bride walked down the aisle, a song she specifically requested she did not want played.

The MC/DJ got the name wrong of one of the groomsmen. I didn't know that Kevin was such a difficult name.  The DJ hardly played any of the music that was submitted. The bride had also requested no group dances (the electric slide, YMCA, etc.) but there were at least 5 of those played back to back.

Victoria's also served only 1 of 2 cake flavors so when the bride asked about the second flavor, she was told they were going to throw it away. Fortunately, they served some of the 2nd flavor and boxed the rest at the bride's request.

Being from STL, it was requested that Bud Light was served. However, it obviously wasn't Bud Light although Victoria's insisted that it was. Someone eventually found out it was Miller Light.

To end the night, the DJ also played a very sweet song telling the guests repeatedly to ""Get out"" when people weren't moving fast enough for them.

Victoria's is obviously a ripe off. I saw no signs that they cared about making this day special for a bride and groom. All we got was attitude because we were making their jobs more difficult. I will say that most guests didn't notice or hear about these issues and enjoyed themselves. However, I would highly suggest you look elsewhere before having your wedding at Victoria's.",11,iWdgozB1Nn_snw9I5KS9Ig

It breaks my heart to give this place a lower review than what it should get but sadly I have no choice.  I'll explain my reason in a minute.

First this bar is a bit hard to find - the outside it a graffiti door that looks like you might enter a murderer's lair.  But fear not because when you open it and walk through you are transported to something that is magical.  Dimly lit, candle lights all over the bar and whiskey bottles suspended from the ceiling give it that sexy and intimate vibe.  Great for a date, or just chilling with a few friends.  It's cool to be let in on the secret of this place :)

The menu is simple with a few selections of whiskey, cocktails and drinks celebrating Japan.  My friend and I each tried different whiskeys and then I also had the Pomme Cannelle.  This was so light a fresh - absolutely delicious with just a hint of cinnamon.  I was impressed.

The vibe and the decor are really cool and I would love to come here again, and to be honest I probably would come back because I just feel so sophisticated and cool here.  However here is my reason for the lower rating:

Firstly I wanted to take some pictures of inside the bar.  My phone automatically set to flash and it went off.  The server immediately came over and informed me that I could take pictures but not with a flash.  That's totally fine with me....except several other people inside the bar were taking pics and I saw their flash go off....but none of them were spoken to.  Hmmmm

Then I got a call so I had the phone to my ear listening to my VM.  It was done discreetly.  But then again the server came over and said that wasn't allowed and shook his finger at me (like no no no).  Once again if you can't be on your phone in here that is fine if that is the rule... but once again I saw someone else on their phone and they weren't spoken to.  At this point the server took away our menus....we felt a bit awkward...like we got drink blocked!   We just paid and left after that.  My friend and I felt that we weren't treated the same as the other patrons in the bar.  We're fine with the rules but they need to apply to everyone.  

I totally understand that if they want this place to be more of a finer establishment with no flash/no phone rule I am fine with that.  They want to cater to a more upscale experience.  I get it.  But perhaps they should have said something to the guy who came in wearing one of those baseball tshirts and sneakers because I am sure he brought down the classiness of the place far more than I did!",6,Kj9cFO70zZOQorN0mgeLWA

The yogurt is low-quality and ridiculously overpriced for being so below average. It's not even mixed the right way, and it doesn't taste that great. Plus the flavor options are very limited and again, nothing of that great of quality. 

I don't mind paying more for frozen yogurt that is worth it, like Red Mango, or Yogurtland. But this stuff just isn't worth it. I gave it a second chance (just because it's so close to my house) and it failed again so I won't ever be going back.",2,hEv6xqaP-5YekpoBftAviw

While it's not truly exceptional food, it's decent if you know what to get and the variety of different types is pretty good.

Basically the theme is that you walk in and they give you a card.  You use that card at the various stalls to buy food.  Some standouts when it comes to food is the seafood section, the sausages on the grill, the new pho soup section and the dessert section.  I hear the waffles/crepes are good to but usually head over to the dessert section instead.  

The dessert section has some low key but satisfying regulars like the ""wahe"" (baked custard with fruit), the napoleon and the pastry with the shredded apple in it with cinnamon (name escapes me for the moment but one of the really good ones) but they rotate some of the dishes regularly.  They also have this great vanilla sauce they put on everything.  They reuse some of their ingredients (custard in one might be custard in another, just baked) but that's ok since they're pretty good.

Indian EDM thumps incongruously from a mounted speaker, quite at odds with the relaxing environment.

There is a 'Coppertini' menu along with a fairly impressive wine list, with a few decent whites by the glass, including a light and refreshing Indian Chenin blanc, which is what I went with.

The menu promises not just the old Indian restaurant standbys but also some modern takes on the country's cuisine, including a tandoori-spiced duck leg confit (not cooked in the tandoor, of which none exists in this restaurant) and dhana dal with scallops.

'Masala Chili Cauliflower Florets: Zesty Soy-Tomato-Scallion Glaze, Toasted Spices, Ginger' ($9) sounded good. In reality what arrived was essentially a pretty poor plate of gobi Manchurian. I understand that the taste in Indian food is towards very crispy batters but this was something else, nowhere near pliable with a fork, and the glaze was reminiscent of over-salted ketchup more than any of the promised spices or zest. Some complimentary naan and completely extraneous chutneys arrived with this, the bread clearly out of a bag, as well as some raita.

For entree I chose 'Kashmiri Chili-Fennel Roasted Lamb Chops, Wild Mushroom Pulao, Lamb-Mushroom Redux' ($27) and was sorely disappointed. The lamb chops, which I requested medium, came rare, and needed knife and tooth to be prised from the bone. That would be excusable were it not for the nearly total lack of flavor. Some fennel came through, but the lamb-mushroom redux on top was simply overpowered by the burnt edges of the chops. The pulao was a bit better, having a genuine earthy hit to it, but not enough to rescue the lamb. With this dish came more of the naan and a vast bowl of basmati rice. Yes, rice to go with the pulao.

I was of no mind to try a dessert after that so that was the end of the meal. Service was professional, if quite reserved.

For just short of $50 this was a hugely disappointing experience. Frankly I am baffled at Copper's excellent reputation. It's a beautiful space and clearly a great deal of thought has gone into the menu, but the food is nowhere near good enough at any price point, much less the one charged.",3,svTDtDxRYX-UaszK0jPtbQ

Everyone I talked too was friendly and professional, and they wanted to make sure I was happy. 

The large room & bathroom were immaculate and welcoming, with a good mattress. Oddly, this company has two separate hotels on one property, and I think the breakfast was in the other building. I didn't want breakfast, anyhow, so i can't comment on it. The lobby was small and needed a new sofa, but who cares? I loved my room and the staff.

Bowling:  pretty typical, maybe 10-12 lanes, plenty of house balls and shoes.  We bowled in a tournament so I can not speak to the cost.  It seemed like my husband and I were bowling really well but I hear that Middleton Sport Bowl is a ""high scoring venue"" so our scores weren't directly related to talent =)  I was surprised that they allowed food and beverage on the lanes - they have buzzers you can hit for service while you're playing.  We didn't use this feature but thought it was a neat idea.
Food/Drink:  We sat in the last couple of spots at the bar and were greeted and served quickly.  They had a tournament going on so the alley was PACKED but they staffed themselves well.  We ordered the Turkey Avocado wrap with fries and the cowboy quesadilla, which arrived quickly.  I thought the wrap was delicious, full of fresh ingredients but my husband commented that there was too much turkey for him.  It was a sort of deli/shaved meat, not chunks.  The fries were good, nice batter and perfect amount.  The quesadilla was perfect, lots of filling and the tortilla was crispy.

My son was crying the whole time  during the haircut; halfway through the haircut another hairstylist shouts at us & says ""You need to stop right now, you're torturing him and we have customers here!"" The lady cutting my son's hair ended up stopping halfway through the haircut. As I am paying full price for my husband's haircut as well as my son's unfinished haircut with patches on his head I say to the stylist that cut my son's hair ""He's a kid, kids cry. He has patches on his head & I just paid full price for his haircut?"". I received no answer to my question or apology. All the hairstylist there that day had horrible customer service skills.

They're too big to walk without seeming awkward, each one about two and a half steps to get up. By the time you walk up all of them, you either feel tired because of how slow you achieved the top or out of breath because of how briskly you had to walk up without feeling too slow. I also always look out to the right and think that in a decade of visiting this museum, I've never been out in that courtyard. Is it even a courtyard? This is besides the point.

If there's any review that makes me feel like a real snob, it's this one.

The Carnegie is more than worth a visit. It's worth a revisit. And a membership. Visit a new area every month for a year. And then revisit each area in the same order for years. The routine won't get old, or maybe it will, I don't really care. My favorite sections are Contemporary Art and Architecture. The wall of chairs is a great snapshot to admire, and the various drawers make me wish I could resist buying furniture at Target.

I don't really like post-war art, because I feel like it's maximalist without purpose, and when the commotion dies down and you look at the more minimal expressions, you're just left with muted tones of mustard yellow and dulled grays. But I'm also a walking hypocrisy, because my favorites of the entire collection are two large post-war pieces.

After walking upstairs, I turn left and walk through a few of the entry ways until I get to the black-and-white canvas on the right of one of the rooms, right when you walk in, Franz Kline's ""Sigfried.""

I usually keep walking until I find the glass doors to the contemporary collection, and after a few other entryways, I stop and sit down on the bench placed to stare at Sigmar Polke's ""Watchtower II.""

If I have time, I explore more. But usually I just resolve to look at everything else another day, at another point in the routine, which cycles back to coming in and reaching the same conclusions.

It's possible you won't like these pieces of art. You could like other pieces more. It's nice to look at art and have opinions.",6,xhVlmdU1sPVH6GBJw6AZtQ

Because our insurance is not the greatest, I'm not able to get most of the care I need.  2 weeks ago I had a tooth crack and was in excruciating pain. The Gilbert office got me in with Dr. Ray very quickly

I have to say he and his assistant are two of the most patient people I've ever met. I was so scared when i got there my blood pressure was way too high to do the surgery. They let me sit and wait for it to come down, they were kind, comforting, concerned and very very understanding. 

My blood pressure remained too high and Dr. Ray could not do the surgery that day but his assistant and the office girls moved me to the Phoenix office for the next morning. I get out there and again because of my fear and pain my BP was too high. 

I'm not sure if this is the type of dental outfit that ""caters to cowards"" but when I started crying both Dr. Ray and his assistant were amazing...again they let me sit, they made me laugh, they assured me I was OK, and boom! With in 15 minutes my BP was down and 30 minutes later I was home with the tooth out and PAIN FREE! 

They went above and beyond!! Completely!

I don't normally write reviews, but nobody could have known how much pain I was in, how scared I was, how embarrassed I was because of my teeth, or how bad I felt that TWICE I held them up because of my BP...But they treated me so kindly and so respectfully. I'll NEVER forget that as long as I live...I'm so happy to say Dr. Ray and his assistant did an amazing job and I'm still pain free. 

The girls at both offices were amazing as well! They understood and were so compassionate..

I hope one day to fix my mouth properly and I know exactly where I'll go to have the surgery!

I bought some chicken for roasting and was floored with how flavourful it was in comparison to regular grocery store chicken. I haven't looked back. 
I went on to try their pork, beef, cured meats; everything I have had has been delicious. I want to try their sausages next! When they are closed, I go to Healthy Butcher as an alternative, though I find Bespoke to have much tastier chicken. (I hate it when they are closed!). Bespoke has a loyalty points program, which can earn you free gifts. I also love that there is parking right outside.
They are certainly more expensive then your average chain grocery store, but I can feel good about the meat I am eating, and on top of that, the taste is on another level. Staff are knowledgable and friendly. I highly recommend Bespoke Butcher to meat all your butcher shop needs!",0,D8JJMjMN2DwpDk1amYsVzA

Splendid Nails has been around for as long as my mom has lived in this neighborhood, which is at least 11 years since I've been coming here since my first prom. I believe any nail shop that can stay open that long is pretty impressive. The owner, by far, gives the best mani/pedi's .. and she is also one of the funniest people I have ever met in my life, but to be quite honest, I have never received bad service from any of the ladies that work here. Ive even gotten full sets here that lasted through football games and softball scrimmages, which is hard to find. They also give a great eyebrow wax too if this is what you are looking for. 

The only reason I am not giving them 5 stars is because one time I was in there enjoying a deluxe pedi ($32) and the fattest grossest man in Arizona walked in looking to get his ""toes cleaned up""... Every single person working in there literally sighed in disgust and clearly started talking shit in Korean.. not that I didn't find this mildly entertaining, I just thought it was kind of, rude, because you could tell dude knew what was going on.

All I wanted was file and polish on my nails and a pedicure.  I called first to make sure they accept walk ins and if it was still okay to come at 6:15, since they close at 7:00. They were very kind and welcomed me.  When I walked in, I was the only customer there.  David filed my nails and painted them, while Victoria worked on my pedicure. They were very friendly and chatted the whole time. I would've preferred a more quiet, relaxed experience, but that's not what happened.  I can look past that, so not a biggie.  I just wanted my nails, feet and toenails to look and feel great. They both did a very quick job on my nails and pedicure. My nails were painted by David with a nude color, which is what I asked for, but it was done in such a sloppy way! The polish was applied unevenly, very blotchy, and the sides and tops of my nails were missed and left bare. I wish I could've taken a picture as soon as I got home to show it, but I couldn't stand looking at them that I removed the polish right away. My nails did not look like they were professionally done!  My pedicure by Victoria was quick as well. The polish was applied much better than the polish on my nails but it wasn't a pedicure that left my feet feeling nice and smooth, which is what a professionally done pedicure should be like.  I feel they rushed to get the job done.  They didn't even have me sit for a bit to let my nails dry. 

If they wanted to get out of there right away, they shouldn't have told me to come in when I called.  I paid for a rushed service just to chat the whole time but walk out with sloppy-looking polished nails and a pedicure that could've been much better, if I had gone elsewhere. I got home and repainted my own fingernails because I couldn't stand seeing the sloppy polish that were on them!  Today was my first and last visit at this place. Also, it's worth a mention that they didn't have a large selection of nail polishes and most of them looked old. Very few OPI, Essie and Orly. Everything else were brands I've never even heard of.

The employees are friendly and seem like they've put up with a lot of thrift shop crazies.  They have incredible amounts of patience.  I can usually find some nice jeans - even labels like Lucky, Gap, Express, etc.  all in nice condition.  You have your regular Goodwill issues - there is certainly a lot of junk here.  As one yelper said, they sell everything from broken glass to mayo jars.  Some of their furniture is over priced, they had an Ikea table that sells for $1 more brand new from Ikea.  But I did find an art easel once for $10, so its usually worth a look.

I enjoyed shopping here and would pop in pretty regularly just to search for treasures, until I stopped in on a Tuesday.  Then I learned that you should NEVER stop here on a Tuesday....

Tuesday is seniors 65+ discount day.   Beware.  These cute elderly ladies turn Goodwill shopping into roller derby on Tuesday.  One woman tried to take a jean jacket right out of my hands.  They all have 87 items in their carts, and want every one wrapped individually in paper for the ride home.  And they are genuinely rude and rough when it comes to an item that may have any value.  So good luck, stay safe, and maybe wear some padding if you've got to stop on Tuesday.",8,QLgFEumhrHq6LgbEOKCzdw

And, it's a good thing we had reservations, too, because this place is quite a hot spot and we otherwise would likely have had a substantial wait for a table.

The atmosphere is lively and the crowd was generally very attractive and the music gave the place a nice vibe.  And, I must say, the wait staff - all of them - were very pleasing on the eyes.  Our server was quite hot and she was very friendly and relaxed.  And, she was very attentive, while remaining unobtrusive.

I enjoyed everything I ordered.  As others have mentioned, the complimentary bread with blue butter is just delicious, but don't fill up on it.  You'll need the room for everything else. 

The Beet salad with goat cheese was quite refreshing and all of the veggies beautifully presented.

We enjoyed two dozen of the oysters on the half shell with an assortment of sauces nicely arranged over ice.

I had the 14 ounce filet on the bone and it was succulent, tender, cooked to perfection and topped with truffle butter - absolutely delicious.

Along with the steak, I also had parmesan crusted truffle fries.

Plus it's an effort for a white guy like me to find a group of pals eager to venture outside their comfort zone. Korean BBQ is about as far as it's gone in past.

That being said, when I do get the chance I savour every minute and every bubbly hot dish that comes out - and let me tell you, I always make sure that since it's all ""I"" can eat, there are plenty of dishes. the night usually ends with me groaning, and making deals with any god that will listen that I'll never eat that much again. The other downside typically is that because everything is cooked in the same broth it all ends up tasting the same which is the only thing that stops me.

Enter, Beijing style hot pot, a whole new adventure to the depths of flavour country. Unlike it's more commonly found counterpart the Beijing style is server in an ornate copper pot (better for conducting heat) and the broth (if you're sticking to the rules) is not much more than water and a few staple herbs and staple ingredients. The result, perfectly and quickly cooked food that allows the natural flavours and quality to do all the talking (instead of masking it with tons of spices and ingredients).

Best of all, the piles, and I'm talking tiny mountains, of freshly cut lamb are never ending and always the star of any visit. 

My recent visit to the appropriately named Beijing Hot Pot Restaurant, located just a few blocks from Fairview Mall in North York was a re-awakening of my taste for Hot Pot - and likely my new go to. It's a newer location with the owners converting their former AYCE sushi joint into this more niche and unique business.

Service is attentive, quick and friendly, and they were more than happy to walk me through the differences and hot this worked (I kinda knew already but I like to play dumb sometimes).

Best of all, you don't really need a small posse, you can come solo or with a friend (or stranger you meet in the line outfront). If you're looking for something different that you you can enjoy all year round, this is the place for you. But make sure you make plans to get their early because they do get busy most nights!

The experience is great when you go with friends whose company you can enjoy while waiting in line. Immediately upon arriving there were two lines. One was for people who did not have tickets and the other was for people who purchased their tickets online. If you didn't have a ticket, you had to wait in line to buy it and then move to the next line with people who bought them online. The line for people who purchased their ticket online took about 10-15 minutes to get through.  Upon entering the ROM there was another line for coat check but I didn't bother waiting, since my friends were already inside. I caught up with them and they were in the line to purchase food and drink tickets. The line was also long but I don't know how long they waited to get to the front.

We first made our way to the upstairs lounge/bar where we all ordered drinks. They had nothing fancy but were able to mix fruit juice, alcohol and soda. We then walked around to check out some of the exhibits, food vendors and DJ's. It was fun to have live music wherever we went. We then decided to wait in line to see the new whale exhibit. The line took about 30 minutes.  The exhibit was really good and we got to see it the night before it opened to the public. They even had an exhibit where you could dress up as a krill. We convinced one of our friends to dress up in the costume and that was fun.

After checking out the whale exhibit we tried some of the food provided by the different vendors. Once again, the lines were kind of long but there were some options that were both gluten and lactose  free.  We then walked around and viewed the dinosaurs and the natural stones exhibit. 

Allover it was a really fun event and it only cost $15.00, which is definitely a bargain. If you go during the day, you need to be quiet and it would cost $30.00 to attend. I would definitely attend Friday Night Live at the ROM again.",1,X-VOe5bzT9EJu_L_Bt0nLQ

Our puppy is very active and inquisitive, which initially meant constant challenges as she wanted to chew everything (including us), steal socks, etc.  We tried an initial lesson with a different trainer, but her 'positive only' approach left us with no tools to correct unwanted behavior other than to 'distract her'.
 
Enter Zenergy Dog Training!  It's a 45-minute drive from our home in Mesa, but after the first lesson I knew we had found the right place to truly help JoJo and our family develop the best relationship possible.  Zenergy is a balanced trainer, and our experience is that the balance so far is about 99% positive reinforcement and 1% correction.  The difference however has been awesome in shaping JoJo's behavior. 
 
She adores RJ and K and remains focused on them throughout the lessons and eager to please.  JoJo was a great pup to begin with, but now she walks wonderfully on a leash, will go to her place upon command (when you need some time to clean around the house), and no longer tries to bolt out the door.  Over time JoJo will only get better and better, but Zenergy Dog Training gave us a wonderful foundation.  I can't thank them enough!",1,IUFnOYqmDVE9Ids6U4lLvg

Normally, I'm not one to like someone in my face asking me if I want them to hold my things at the counter, but that particular visit I didn't even get as much as a glance. Everyone was just standing around talking. I had called 20 minutes prior to my arrival to ask if they had a palette in stock, which they did. I then asked the girl I spoke with to hold it at the front counter as I'd be in within the hour. My palette was not held and I had to find it on my own. Walking and looking for it isn't what bothers it. It's the fact that I asked for it to be held and it wasn't.

Since it's the holiday's and the location I went into is inside of JCPENNY, they're giving out  pins with every purchase that you enter the code online and you could possibly win a prize. Well, I ended up winning a $5 certificate. I was so excited. I was going to go back and buy another palette! I called twice to make sure I could use it in Sephora. Both times, I was assured I'd be able to. So, I went and picked out my palette. Again, with terrible service and no one asked me if I needed help finding anything. I finally picked which one I wanted and headed to the register. I handed her my item and asked her to hold on so I could pull up my $5 certificate on my phone. She said ""Oh, we don't take those here."" At first I thought she was joking, but then I could tell she was serious. She said ""we just give them out"". 

What kind of crap is that? You give the pins away, but if I win a certificate, you won't honor it? That's probably the dumbest thing I have ever heard. I am so livid over this. They HAD a 2 star rating, but this will SURELY bring them right on down to 1.",4,STOEjNx83UTDHvov0C6uXA

They're always smiling & willing to help. One of the valet people, he was tall Hispanic guy this afternoon, he helped me with my luggage this week (it was really heavy!) but he didn't say a word or show that it was heavy lol. I also appreciated that he actually initiated a conversation with me instead of treating me like every other customer. I didn't have to wait long for someone to take care of my car or return it back to me. I've had things stolen from my car before from previous valet people at other casinos but I breathed a sigh of relief when all my things were still there. 

The rooms were very clean in my room as well. I love hotel pillows!!! I thought about stealing one but I didn't want to get charged for it lol. (PLEASE TELL ME WHERE U GET YOUR PILLOWS!) 

The cleaning crew left my room alone on the days I requested it to be left alone, and they did a wonderful job in cleaning up when I left my door knob normal, indicating its okay to come in.

Not just because we love Vincenzo but for many other reasons...including loving him.
He has assisted Chef with creating one of the most compassionate fine dining experiences in the city.


Whenever hubby has to entertain business clients he usually picks Panevino because of the amazing choices on all the menus and of course the amazing service.

We have been here a dozen times for lunch but we mostly dine for dinner.
Hubby and I also enjoy happy hour and how we can order entrees in the comfy bar booths.

It's the little things...for example when you sit down at your table they actually ask me if I would like a black napkin (if wearing a black skirt or dress pants) so that the lint from a white cloth napkin will not attach into my clothing. Now that is service. 
Of course at most fine dining places they do this and place and remove you napkin (hopefully) but for some reason the extremely sweet personal service...you forget you are in fine dining and that you are not actually with just really awesome family members. LOL.

Chef and staff make everything fresh from scratch every morning. 

Our daytime experiences have been equally lovely when getting lunch. For some reason I have never purchased from the deli but we are sooo stuffed after to even look at food :) (in a good way).

We always get presented with a personal amuse bouche. :) 

We order of the vegan menus so the items below are all from that menu.

APPS:
The Artisan bread is out of this world.

Eggplant hummus rolls...wow! I stole the concept and make them at home all the time. 
(the secret to the purple cabbage is a very slow roast with a lot of red wine)

Sometimes we split a Caesar.  


ENTREES:
Gnocchi.....ummmmm these are really from the heavens...they are not traditional but there are just a few (very filing) gnocchi spread down a narrow long plate. Wow...creamy, yummy.

Burger this thing is huge...I'm not just saying in size but also in flavor. It's mashed potato based. It's thick it's soft and it is amazing. Honestly this hug plate is a split. We have never split it because hubby always wants something different but I take home more than half. I put all the items in a to-go and keep the bread out separate. It makes reheating in the oven perfect. 
The veg broth that comes with it is amazing. I could really take a bath in that stuff. And grilled veggies are yummy as usual.

The shells and the bolognese are pretty good...but out of the three pasta and sauce dishes I prefer the tortelloni they are spinach and they melt in your mouth! Their shells do have that magical vodka sauce on them. Yum. I need to ask for a side of that next time to dip things in :)

The risotto...I swear they really put about $40 (I know the price of rare mushrooms thanks to Whole Foods awesome spread I divulge into every week) of mushrooms in this dish. Also the dish is super creamy and super rich. It's perfect. Really this dish is rather large also.


DESSERTS:
We have not tried the gelato. We are not big frozen dessert people (unless it's Perfect Scoop's ice cream) so we always decline the try.

Decedent Chocolate Pudding...it's a must. Leave 1/2 of your entree if need be :) but they always send out our (well our group calls them VIP brownies) fav brownies and a lovely wish on the plate :) But this pudding is awesome and I have never really liked pudding. It's really amazing with an espresso with a lemon twist or maybe a shot of Fran :)  


Please try out Panevino. It's an amazing date option, group option, business lunch/dinner option...it's just fresh, yummy and amazing.

Oh and when you get there:

Ask for Vincenzo and then tell him that Eizabeth sent you...you will be very pleased :))))))))))))))))",17,zgV0ZroIF956gw4cul8MHA

We also attended their first family style dinner and could not have been more impressed.

I loved the atmosphere here... open, modern, chill, and very friendly baristas.  Its not often you find a coffee place that offers seating with such a large space. We got here in the late morning and wanted a good kick of flavour and caffeine.  You have your choice of outside benches, inside tables where you can work on your laptop, or some lounging chairs to relax in.  The place has huge windows so it never feels like a cave but a really nice happy sunny spot.

The menu is quite cool as it has cashew milk as an offering.  Last time we tried it was in Buffalo where it add an unique nutty note to the cappuccino.  We ended up getting the cashew cappuccino and a dirty chai with almond milk.

Cashew cappuccino - At a premium price of $7, this is possible one of the most expensive coffee drinks we've tried in Toronto.  It is a regular smaller size and seeing how we tried it in Buffalo, we know it's not easy to source and it can be a bit more expensive.  Is it worth it?  uh... not quite.  I'm not sure if this cashew milk was super watery but the espresso was very diluted and it just tasted really watery.  For the price of $7, I would definitely skip.  3/5

Dirty Chai - It's not always a good sign when your barista goes ""Oh that's new"" when you request your drink.  Suffice to say, the flavours were really imbalanced as well with most of it being water.  I didnt get any tea flavour, spices, or even a good espresso note.  A lot of it was muddled water unfortunately.  3/5

Overall, great atmosphere to relax, catch up on emails, or enjoy the sun while getting a coffee.  Perhaps it was an off day but I'd skip the drinks here.",28,PGeiszoVusiv0wTHVdWklA

The food is fairly mediocre and portions are predictably small but, thankfully, the prices are more reasonable than you'd expect from looking at the place.

The yam soup ($6) got things off to a good start -- very good and a little spicy. The fries ($6), served with mayo, were also very good. The vegetarian sandwich ($7) is where things failed.

I sadly actually recently moved from Las Vegas and still fly in just to get my hair done by Stacy. Every trip to the salon is amazing not just for the best hair but the energy in the salon from all the staff is always so positive. 

Many of the hair artist there have been on board for years and they are one Hot family and all amazing at what they do. I really see how each client bonds and gets excited to catch up with their own personal hair stylist. 

Stacy introduced me to the Keratin Hair treatment when it first game out. I can not even explain how this has changed my life. My hair before was frizzy and all over the place. Now with the treatment it takes less then half the time to style it and its healthier and softer then when I was a child. I love it.

I really wish there was a Globe salon in LA but I will continue to make the trip to make sure my hair is always in the best hands. I always stock up on product too. Globe carries lines that a bit more exclusive from hair to skin all top of the line. Great hair and skin is a reflection has def powered my confidence and I Thank the Amazing Globe salon staff for that .",0,xcC32UePLUY4IaB0h5Nq6g

2)The music is a radio station, complete with annoying, repetitive GreatClips ads (Men's haircuts just $7.99!!!). Come on, just plug in an iPod and play some constant music. No one wants to listen to radio ads while chilling at the coffee house. 

Coffee was fine. The food looked good; people have complained about the prices, but why are you going to a coffee place for food? It was maybe a dollar on the pricey side, I guess.

You see, I am a Melt fanatic, but even the cheesiest fan has a hard time waiting 2 hours to eat with 2 kids in tow. Unfortunately, this location had just as long a wait as the other. 

This time I ordered 'The Dude Abides' - a sandwich packed with deep-fried cheese sticks, marinara, and meatballs. It was previously a monthly special that was brought back due to popular demand. My wife got the West Side Montecristo (her fall-back option, which is, in my opinion, their best sandwich). I thought my Dude Abides was a fantastically good idea and overall was very tasty but I found the meatball to be very dry. I think that if I get it again I will ask for extra sauce in case the meat comes out dry again.

Our server was slightly unfriendly, but since she was very attractive, I will choose to overlook her less-than-awesome attitude. Besides, most people don't go to Melt for the service - heck, after waiting for 2 hours to eat, you'll be begging for them to just throw it at you.

Atmosphere is cute & homey, with an open kitchen, which was bustling with take-out action the entire time we were there.
I had the halibut and my husband had the haddock. I love the sweetness halibut has, and the batter was not overpowering to this somewhat delicate fish - husband liked the haddock very much. Tartar sauce is fresh & tastes homemade, which is a HUGE plus for me!
Will definitely be back through the winter, I really liked eating it fresh & hot (most fish & chips are take out, or outdoor seating).

Of course the wait was 1.5 hours but we were able to snag a spot at the bar and order a pitcher of margarita (definitely not the best I've had) and order some chips and guac. The guacamole is really good.
We ended up being seated at a nice booth in the back. It's super loud in there, so be prepared to scream to hear one another.
We each ordered 4 tacos - a bit much as I couldn't finish my 4th one.  I ordered the cod which two of us agreed was the best. My friend thought the oxtail was the best (special of the night). I did not like the beef cheek as I thought the beef had a weird flavour. I liked the fried cheese one, but felt the beans overpowered the saltiness of the cheese so made it kind of bland.
The churros I thought were great, especially because of the caramel sauce that comes with it.

Super glad I finally got to check this place out as it's been on my list for a while. But I don't think it's worth a 1.5 hour wait (maybe try a week night if you're going to go) and I probably won't be back.",0,-B4Cf2XLkPr9qMlLPHJAlw

As for this eater, I stick to the red tamale combo--beans / rice added.  The masa is first rate and the shredded beef is spiced well for a real mc coy. 

You can wash that one down with a tamarind soda or horchata if you like.

My tip for fellow yelpers east of the Mississippi river, where good masa is hard to find, go ahead and order a dozen tamales packed cold for your carry on bag--even a five hour flight gets them into the freezer to stay great tasting for months.

My fellow travelers have taken on the burritos and tostadas, with positive remarks.  Tortillas are genuine--hard to ruin a bean/cheese otherwise.

This is not your typical Indian style but more of chipotle style Indian fast food with great taste and flavor profiles. The food was simply awesome. Coming from and Indian you can take it as a done deal. The Chicken Tikka bowl was perfect with the tikka sauce. Biryani was great. Salmon...Did not even think that it would be that good. 

I tried the paneer sandwich and felt the bread was too soggy. But still giving 5 starts for rest of the items and service. I am pretty sure they will introduce more sauces as they grow. 

Fantastic food. Please don't go to this place expecting something similar to your home cooked or regular Indian food. But, the taste and flavors are as good as they can get for this set up.

The restaurant itself looks a little drab and old, like there used to be a previous restaurant residing here. Nevertheless, the famous Hash House a Go Go name doesn't disappoint. 

BEWARE: This place tends to get super busy, especially on weekends. So either come really early...or really late. 

I came here with three other people and was forewarned about the portions here. When we tried to order our entrees we were told that there was a charge for sharing (what?!). Thankfully, our waitress suggested that we order two entrees and two sides so we could bypass the nonsense charge. First off, my friend and I ordered morning cocktails: a pineapple champagne cocktail and a hibiscus. Unfortunately, the drinks were not good. Save the money, it's not worth it. 

Interesting menu tid-bit: Look up on their menu O'Hare of the Dog. Only in Vegas would they have that as a menu item. 

As far as entrees went, we ordered the House Smoked Fresh Salmon Hash and the Sage Fried Chicken Farm Benedict with two sides: Mac and Cheese and some vegetables. The Hash was actually not very good at all. I swear the salmon tasted like it came out of a can and it was super dry. We ended up picking at it throughout the  meal and didn't even finish it. Now the Farm Benedict on the other hand....AMAZING!!!! Hands down one of the best entrees I've had for breakfast EVER! I couldn''t stop eating it! It was a combination of fried chicken, mashed potatoes, biscuits, and gravy heaven. I wish we had ordered two of these. Thank goodness our waitress recommended it!! She also recommended the Brown Sugar Banana flapjacks, which I've read on yelp are amazing, but we didn't order it this time around. 

I would definitely say that the food saves this place. I can't speak for other locations. The service was sub-par, and for some reason they couldn't find any extra plates for us as well as silverware! It wasn't even that busy the morning we went so how does that happen? 

Definitely coming back here for breakfast whenever I'm in Sin City. I wouldn't mind trying other locations as well. One thing's for sure: I'm gonna order that Farm Benedict next time.",1,3J1zT17J07X5OUeFq0lgMQ

Service was very attentive but not perfect. Although our orders were written down, the sides were messed up and the servers blamed the food runner on the mistake when it wasn't he who punched in the chit.

I did feel like I was dining in a high end establishment and I appreciated the old school style of the waiters. I never felt like they were 'doing me a favor' by serving me as you sometimes feel at high end restaurants downtown. No chips on shoulders here!

now, the food..

the garlic bread, pickles, olives and hot peppers were very good, but that's not what I'm coming for.

the 18 dollar a person Cesar salad was skillfully prepared but was very bland. it needed some seasoning, whether it be more parmesan or some salt, but maybe they are just staying within the main theme of the food at the octagon, which is that nothing is seasoned.

I'm talking about salt and pepper, flavour enhancer!!

My rib eye was cooked as I had ordered it but it did not see even one fleck of salt before it hit the grill.

aesthetically, grill marks were randomly distributed and it was sitting in a huge puddle of juice, accompanied by the saddest greyish brown mushrooms you've ever seen. the eye of my rib eye was not tender. I've had much better rib eyes at the keg.

my steak was a huge disappointment, especially considering that steaks are their speciality.

I ordered fries hoping for thin, crispy frites but received a pile of unseasoned wavy cut disks of fried frozen potato. I tried the garlic mashed potatoes which were also awful. 

two people with my group ordered the ribs which are probably the best value on the menu. the ribs I tried were well cooked, not the overcooked mush that releases from the bone with no effort that most people seem to think good ribs are like. the only problem was that they were barely sauced. 


with tax and tip, we averaged just under 75 a person which is 50 bucks too much.

Honestly, if it weren't for 1 major taboo, Quinn Farms would be a solid 4 stars.

However as a previous Yelper already reported, I have to dock 2 stars since they use a practice that is a huge problem for me. They charge you an entrance fee of $5 per person and they will even charge children AS YOUNG AS 2 YEARS OLD!!!! Savages. I've gone to countless farms all over the Montreal region and Quinn Farms is the only one that will ask you for an admission fee. Insane! It cost us $15 just to get in! Produce is extra of course.

The prices for produce is decent, 1 large, 1 medium and 1 small pumpkin cost us $9. They charge by the pound and I believe the weight is 40 cents per. Reasonable but when you paid $15 to get in.... Unacceptable.

There are other ways to circumvent people who come here and don't buy, perhaps charging a smaller fee ($2) would be good. They also shouldn't ask money for children under 5. They could ask you to pay for your bags prior of going in.... in general... anything but this.",4,_4NHePAXLhcloTD04wqpqw

This place has good food but really there's a lot of wait, to that extent that you could be waiting for over an hour. The place is small and cramped up, so would not recommend for groups. 

We did take out, placed the order at 0650pm, was told it would take half hour. We ordered Chicken Boti with Butter Naan, Chicken Karahi, Chicken Biryani and 1 Extra Butter Naan. 

So I reached at 0745, almost an hour late only to know the order was not ready yet. In the meantime another customer came and was quarreling asking to speak to manager, he was told Nihari was available and an hour later when he came to pick up, he was told its finished and they don't have any. 

The wait time for dine in close to 45mins, the staff is cooperative and tries to accommodate to their best. There is no designated waiting area and with the little space, it can be difficult with kids. The parking area is also very small so it's better to park in the opposite the street Centre area. I realized this 20 mins after maneuvering my car around. 

Finally After waiting for another 45mins, I got my order. The food was good, Chicken Karahi was great, best was the Chicken Boti, chunks of Chicken Marinated in great spices. The disappointment was the Biryani, didn't like it much, too much cardamom and have had far better ones. 

Price wise the place is nominal and the food provides the cost value, just not the time value.

Yes, I want my toliet to have a blow dryer (no paper required unless you have dropped a deuce), seat heating, massage options, water jet adjustments (so many witty responses to be had here, but too inappropriate), automatic lid opening, and automatic flushing, which can all be accessed by a control panel on the wall!

I've always visited Geisha on the weekend before heading out to Old Town and really love coming here on Sunday nights (1/2 price drinks and apps!). They have a DJ every weekend night playing great tunes while you eat yummy sushi and stare at dead rock stars behind the bar. Yep, there are beautiful photos of Jimi Hendrix, Jim Morrison, and Sid Vicious along with a rock (literally) themed wall and sculpture in the middle of the restaurant.  I really enjoy the sushi here and have never had a bad roll. My absolute favorite drink to get tipsy on is their Kinki Kooler. It consists of Dragonberry vodka, fresh kiwi, and lime juice. So delicious, before you know it you have downed three and started dancing to the music in your chair, yep, you are that person! You're welcome.

Service has always been great, friendly, attentive staff. Once it gets busy it can be hard to find the hostess, but when she does, you get helped right away. There are also private karaoke rooms that one can rent out for an event which all have patios that you can sit at and people watch at night (that is always a good time). I did notice about four TV's inside playing a football game, while there were an additional four outside playing a different game. Generally, these TV's have on music videos so it was interesting to see sports, I'm not sure how that happened, because the crowd here doesn't strike me as interested in sports.",1,TBLdjYJMIDaM6dB23AenLw

As a resident of the great Mount W I've been able to experience this popular tourist spot from a different point of view. I honestly never tire of viewing the city from the mountain. It's beautiful whether it's during the day when you can see all the action downtown and all the rivers or at night where the lights transform the city into a dazzling view. 

I take walks over to Grandview frequently in the summer and I never tire of the view, but one thing I also like to do is keep any eye on the houses. It always seems as if some house is being redone along Grandview. It's fun to watch the progress over the months. Plus it usually ends up being bigger and better than before. 

The most exciting news as of late is the planned hotel right by the Mon Incline. The building has sat there vacant and ugly for what seems like forever so it's going to be exciting watching that construction. Make sure to walk along Shiloh Ave. to grab something to eat at Redbeards (full name is Redbeards Resort and Yacht club, which I think it hilarious!) or get ice cream at Difiore's. There's also a coffee shop right by the ice cream shop that is good for early mornings or cold fall nights. 

If you're feeling really up for a walk and some major hills follow Grandview west all the way to the other side of the mountain (opposite side of where the Mon Incline is at). It's honestly not a far walk at all and it's great to see the other side of the mountain. There's a good amount of restaurants on this part. The majority of them are on the pricey side. I enjoy Monterey Bay which is at the top of a high rise apartment complex or Isabela's on Grandview which is almost to the end of Grandview. 

The other Incline, the Duquesne In cline, is located here as well. This one is different from the Mon Incline because there's tons of pictures, artifacts and information on the inclines and Pittsburgh. It's also great to see the western side view of the city. You really can't go wrong from any angle up here though!",9,4wp4XI9AxKNqJima-xahlg

As I mentioned in my review for their sister shop (C2) I don't care much for range shooting so I am biased in my review. The storefront is pretty weak; not much selection of fire arms and what they do have leaves a lot to be desired. They also have knives, range bags, ammo, optics, suppressors, cleaning supplies (which they actually do have a decent selection of stuff for), and guns for rent. The range is full of antiquated equipment and are fairly narrow which gives me anxiety. I will admit that the range master is very top-notch and one of the ladies at the front was abrasive when we first came in but warmed up and became friendly when we engaged her. They offer a lot of safety classes and ladies shoot free two nights a week. It's in a hidden spot so keep your eyes open.",2,u3rRXtoRxE5W1O19yVfslA

Walked in on a Saturday at 1pm. Three people besides myself inside the restaurant. Three employees behind the counter. I walked up to the register. I was not acknowledged or even looked at. One employee was on the phone and the other two were talking to each other with their backs to me. A minute passed and nothing. At that moment I should have realized it was going to be a bad experience. 

One employee eventually comes to the register and doesn't say ""hi"" or ""sorry for the wait"", but just says, ""for here?""  (The one on the phone still feet away never acknowledging me).  

I ordered at 1:04pm. I ordered a simple grilled cheese sandwich. I sat down. At 1:28 no food or service telling me they made an error. In that time several employees from the kitchen go behind the counter and talk relaxed to each other. Working is an afterthought to all of them. I go to the front counter and ask to speak to a manager because I have yet to get my food. An employee goes to the back and never returns. Another employee standing there eventually comes up and says, ""I am in charge right now, what's wrong."" I said I want to get refunded and want to speak to an owner. She goes to the phone. Talks on it for two minutes and then hangs up. Then proceeds to go back to work and not acknowledge me again. I confront her and say, ""where is the manager."" She said, ""he is not here and will be here in 15 minutes. You can wait for him."" 

The audacity for her to suggest that I could wait after I waited 30 minutes for a grilled cheese that was never made. I walked out. I doubt I will ever return. 

I had stopped going there as often due to two previous health violations from the SNHD and poor customer service. Today solidified my desire to not return and make sure people know they have work to do.",3,J-9qnfKNaiqS0N2IE1RwKg

The decor is trendy, they played a good mix of music, and have ""party rooms"" that are separated with red curtains.

Parking is validated which is a big bonus for downtown!  After we were seated we were kept waiting for awhile before the server came to check on us.  They have a summer prix fixe menu of four courses for $35.  The portions were more generous than I anticipated.

First course: Feta Bruschetta on toasted Calabrese baguette served with garlic and olive oil, topped with fresh tomatoes and feta cheese.  The tomatoes were fresh, and the feta cheese was divine.  Tres yummy!  

*NB* This was infinitely better than the bread basket they brought out.  The bread basket was stale, and the bread was cold.  Balsamic vinegar and olive oil are available at the table.  

Second Course: Insalata Estate with mixed greens, strawberries, slivered almonds, goat cheese and a raspberry vinaigrette.  Can you believe I was already starting to get full by the second course?  This salad is the same as an entrÃ©e sized Spinach Salad at Milestone's.  I loved the strawberries and goat's cheese.  However, the raspberry vinaigrette was too overpowering.  My word of advice - ask for the dressing on the side!

Third Course: Vitello a la Romana which is a tender provimi veal with fresh garlic, baby arugula and white wine topped with fresh slices of shaved parmesan.  It is served with steamed vegetables and potatoes.  The dish was swimming in oil!  The parmesan cheese was WAYYYY too salty, and the vegetables were bland.  The potatoes however, were quite savoury.

Fourth Course: Strawberry Cheesecake served with a chocolate drizzle.  I absolutely adored the cinnamon cheesecake base.  The cheesecake was quite tasty, although I found it to have a ""chalky"" consistency.  That didn't prevent me from devouring the entire slice, whipped cream and all!

In addition to the summer fixe menu I also ordered a grilled calamari that was slightly burnt, served on a bed of mixed greens.  If I had known the generous portion sizes of the summer fixe menu I would've passed on ordering another appetizer.  Again, a generous portion of calamari showed up on my plate.  

I also got to sample the Pizza Della Nonna, topped with tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese, green olives, pepperoni and mushrooms.  It was a thin crust pizza that was delicious.  I did notice that some parts of the crust were burnt.  

The cheese ravioli was also quite tasty, although the cheese again had a ""chalky"" consistency to it.  I think the primary suspects in both the cheese ravioli and cheesecake chalky-ness was ricotta cheese!  

A bottle of E.J. Gallo White Zinfandel was ordered for the table.  It rang in at $37 for the bottle.

Verdict:
At the end of the day with tax and tip the bill came to $470 for our party of 8.  A few things I noticed was that the bread basket came out after our appetizers arrived, the servers didn't know who ordered what when the courses were brought to the table (we all had to raise our hands like roll call in primary school to claim our dishes) and there was a delay in the offering of parmesan cheese and ground pepper when the mains were brought out.  Positive things were that our water glasses were constantly replenished, and the hostess did a little something special for the birthday girl's dessert.  

Vagabondo is a nice place to go to for a private dining area, and its complimentary parking.  The ambiance and music make it a trendy restaurant.  I am definitely keeping this on my list of places to book a party at.  That and it is in close proximity to Pravda Vodka Bar in case you want to have an after party ;)",4,HFItzRohDHZvcKDrM6ABZg

From the outside the restaurant looked promising, although parking was limited, despite not being very busy.  **If you can't find parking, I would recommend trying the lot across the street from Rite Aid.**  The inside decor was nice, but it left me confused as to what type of atmosphere they were trying to create.  

What I (we) ordered:  
Kung Pao Cauliflower -  The ONLY thing that we all enjoyed
Raw Oysters - I've had less sand in my mouth after face-planting on the beach
BBQ Shrimp - I don't mind taking the shell off the tail, but the legs too??  Pass....
Dirty Rice - NOPE
Grilled Scallion Noodles - If a look on someone's face could completely embody a subpar yelp review, it was the look my girlfriend's mother gave me after these were delivered to our table.  In all fairness, the look she gave could've also been due to her disapproval of her daughter's choice in men, but I remain hopeful that it was the noodles!

Lastly - my girlfriend ordered a glass of wine and it came in a dirty glass.   This isn't a big deal.  Things slip through the cracks.  But when we brought this to their attention (when I say ""we"", I of course mean her), they literally brought back the same glass with an obvious attempt of just wiping it down instead of giving her a new glass.  Come on now!

Let's start from getting seating. I have an app that takes up precious space on my phone. However, I don't really know what signing in on the apps gets you. One time I signed in and the app said wait time 45 minutes. So in 30 minutes we left and came in only to be greater with okay so it looks like it will be an hour and twenty minutes. We promptly left. The next time we used it the wait time was correct however people who got there and put their name in were seated before us so I have to question what the app really gives you.

Next the menu/food. Though the menu is large, half of it is booze- pricey booze. 6 bucks for a beer- no thanks. We ordered an app at 10 bucks a pop the most recent time, after waiting 40 minutes, yes after 40 minutes our waiter finally came over and we got to ask where our app was. He was surprised that it wasn't there so we just cancelled it. I guess the one good thing is they text you when your table is ready so you know how gruelingly long you've been waiting for to eat minus the time it took to order. The food that did come out was alright not great. We've had the burgers, the pizza, salads and the veggie burgers. 

We would probably recommend the burger 1st but gee doesn't Akron have enough burger places already?",1,_R2BRaoABgwTwHeWKMZkrw

Why not, I wasn't really interested in any of the football games on TV; I enjoy getting tattoos, this should be just as fun right?  Probably not, but I could afford another concert ticket for the week with an additional thirty spot.  

I had to wait for about fifteen minutes before anyone would even approach me.  The waiting area is pretty huge and they had some lighthearted Leslie Nielson movie playing on screens all over the place.  A very fitting movie to loosen a patient up before draining fluids from them.  That was distasteful, my apologies.  

The woman at the front counter approached me and told me that I had to fill out an application and wait for the donation.  Forget it, it really wasn't worth it in the first place.  

I waited for my sister outside and a Jamaican security guard forced me to step away from the door.  ""Look man, I am just waiting for a ride,"" I said.  Well he wasn't impressed.  ""Step back man,"" he said.  Fine, two stars for the Leslie Nielson movie.",4,_5FF5NN5kHZmGTNuJwpnhg

The waitress, however, rushed our order and was obviously displeased that we came in late. Regardless, we ordered before 5.

Food was pretty good. The scones are absolutely delicious and the sandwiches were pretty tasty. The desserts were pretty meh; most were heavy and over sweet. The desserts tasted like the cheap kind you can get at Safeway. Tea was fine, I would have preferred a stronger flavor.

I was most displeased when I got the check. First, the waitress and the menu made no indication that certain tea flavors cost more when chosen as part of high tea. Second, they included a 18% service charge. There was only two of us and the rude waitress did not make me want to tip so much.

You get 5 star quality side table service. 

The Mai Tai was so good. Didn't realize how much alcohol they put it in until it crept up on me later. 

Food was fresh and really tasty. 

Shrimp Won Tons- most places serve these with imitation crab and you normally can't find a place to serve good quality won tons anymore. These were crunchy and delicious. Not greasy like in most places.

Chicken Salad with peanuts - this was good but out of the whole meal would be last on my list to reorder. Peanuts were all I could taste. 

Chicken Lettuce wraps- not overpowered by the sauce and crunchy but again would probably put this item second to last. 

The Strawberry chicken brought back good memories. Just as I remember from childhood. It was still crisp outside with it even smothered in strawberry sauce. My fork going through didn't make it turn to mush so good job balancing the crisp outside while you still have plenty of sauce. 

All time favorite is Am Lee Beef!!! Can't describe in words how good.

When school started up, she had removed all but five on the right side of her head. I was so jealous. Fast forward to two weekends ago, and I'm sitting in Africana Hair Braiding Center anxiously awaiting getting my cornrows, the week before my 40th birthday!

Nikki was my stylist and she did a fantastic job. She needed to add synthetic hair because mine was too short; I think it also helped to hold the braids together. In about an hour and a half, Nikki had finished my entire head and provided me with instructions on how to care for my braids: don't wash it and sleep in a black cap. The cost was only $55 for the braiding, which I think is extremely inexpensive considering the time and talent Nikki has.

Throughout the following work, I couldn't wait to go out and show off my new 'do. I recommended Africana Hair to everyone who asked, which was quite a few people because white boys in cornrows doesn't seem that common.

So, nine days with cornrows ended with Nikki taking them out in 20 minutes. She brushed out my hair and when I asked if I had curly hair, she said it looked on ""one of those natural hair girls."" Aww.",3,pKn_H1nkgrwJS6TuHODsvQ

I'm not sure why I have never written a review before, but this one is now being prompted by the one bad review on here.  A couple years ago I rescued a boxer puppy and wanted him to be properly socialized.  A friend recommended K-9 Kountry.  One Sunday my partner and I happened by the place by accident and pulled in to get some info.  We were informed that they only show the facility by appointment. When we explained that we only had Sundays off, Andrea and George accommodated us and gave a tour.  So when I saw that one review complaining about the customer service, I can only assume that woman was being rude herself.  At K-9 dogs always come first.  I figure that the reason for an appointment is that it allows for the nannies to focus on the dogs without any disruptions of strange people walking through.  Environment and stability are giving the utmost importance, and one of the things I love about the place and the staff. 

I have so many great things to say I hardly know where to start.  K-9 Kountry, or ""WannagoseeGeorge?"" as my dog knows it, is unlike any dog care facility I ever experienced.  I guess when I think about what is important to me, as a dog owner, it's that when I leave my dog he gets the same level of care that I give him.  That's what George, Andrea, and the staff provide, they make Sig feel like family.  He loves it.  It's like a home away from home for him.  I'm not kidding either, the facility is a house that is modified for dogs.  There are no kennels and the dogs ""free-range"".  The yard is huge and sectioned off into different areas for the dogs to play, including an agility course.  Did I forget to mention Pebble Beach??  The nannies are well-trained, professional and friendly.  I walk in with Sig and I hear his name ringing out... it reminds me of Cheers... ""Norm"", lol.  The best part is that the dogs are supervised 24/7.  That's reassuring to me.  There are also special occasions for the dogs, birthday pawties, Halloween costume pawty, Barksgiving, a Christmas get-together (with Santa!!).  When I pick up Sig after his stay at K-9 Kountry, he comes home and curls up for a nap, exhausted from playing all day.  There is nothing more rewarding than knowing he had fun while getting exceptional care.    

I can't possibly end this review without mentioning Andrea's commitment to holistic care.  Occasionally, I'll pick up Sig and Andrea will point out an ear problem, a rash, or a bump that I didn't even notice.  She'll offer up a holistic remedy for the issue.  She's saved me lots of money on needless, frantic Vet visits.  I also have my dog on a raw food diet.  It's nice to have someone so knowledgable to turn to with my questions and concerns about proper nutrition.  I would have to say that K-9 Kountry has met my expectations and more.  The one thing I will caution anyone planning on taking their dog to K-9 Kountry, your dog will be ruined for any other boarding or doggy daycare facility!  Sometimes I want to stay there!!",5,QwXCVlwk99_fLZfKsCVahA

I will say that this particular situation did not happen to me, but two very close friends of mine.  Based on how one of my friend in particular was treated, I will not return to FEZ.  A few weeks ago we all went in to enjoy FEZ's great Tuesday Night Signature Martini For $3 special... it is a pretty sweet deal, which makes this even harder!  There were three of us in attendance that evening and all of us paid with our credit cards.  My good friend goes home days later to find a charge on her account for FEZ that occured on a day when she hadn't even visited the restaurant... pretty scary right?  So naturally she gets a little worried that her bank account has been compromised, and contacts the bank and contacts the management at FEZ.  The manager on duty apparently didn't have the ability to remedy her situation and said that the restaurant manager would need to call her back.  According to my friend he was less than accomodating when returning my friends call.  He did however mention that there was a glitch in their computer system which caused this to happen to others.

To the restaurant managers and owners... sometimes a little compassion and understanding goes a LONG way!!

VYlytAxK8r1kH6jOc62Ozw,0,2011-09-15 06:23:33,0,7J49i5GNxHBjWaKq0pg8gQ,1,"I went to Ki the other night with several co-workers while on business in Calgary (where I've been spending a lot of time lately). While there were some positive aspects of the restaurant, I left hungry and very disappointed.

Let's start with the positives...

The staff were very friendly and attentive. It made the restaurant feel inviting, even though it was relatively empty on this Tuesday evening. This is something a lot of restaurants get wrong, so I was happy to see it.

The interior was striking. High ceilings and a very modern look. I have to admit it didn't quite feel as ""modern Japanese"" as the restaurant strives to be and was a bit oddly segmented (and thus didn't seem to be buzzing). But it was clean and impactful. No complaints.

Unfortunately, once I took a glance at the menu things started to go awry. It's spendy. I mean, *really* spendy. Maybe it's really high quality, though? Sadly, not true.

What did I eat?

I started with the assorted seaweed salad. I wanted something fresh, light and healthy to start. It was a surprisingly large portion for a starter, though it was probably meant to share. It was almost like they had done something to take the flavor of the seaweed and was surprisingly chewy. Even the dressing, which provided some flavor, did not do enough to salvage the dish.

I also started with a miso soup. This dish baffled me. It was so salty. So salty you couldn't even taste the usual layers of flavor in a good miso soup. The best way to describe it? Imagine going to the ocean. Go ahead. I'll wait. Now put some of that delicious ocean water in a bowl. And heat it up. Yeah, isn't that tasty?

Next up was some toro sashimi. The portion size was very tiny. Really thin cuts. Honestly, it didn't taste very fresh. It was oddly stiff, yet slimy -- which made me wonder if it was frozen. I don't think it was, but I think it just wasn't good-quality toro. For the price, disgraceful. I get toro 3 times as good for half the price in Vancouver.

My co-workers had an assortment of rolls, which I sampled a bit of. They were a mishmash of flavors that didn't entirely work, and the fish in them suffered from the same issues as my toro. I will note, however, that while they did not enjoy their meals, they liked things a bit better than I did.

To finish, I had the hot plate of scallops. This was the best of the dishes I had. The scallops were pretty well-cooked, but the seasoning wasn't quite right and they put some other flavors on the plate that really overpowered the scallop. When you have good scallops, don't mask them!

I never like giving a one star review or a five star review. You have to really earn each of those ratings. When I'm having trouble deciding on what to rate a restaurant, I always fall back on Yelp's helpful guide. A two star rating is ""Meh. I've experienced better."" That's definitely true for Ki. And it would get a two star rating if it weren't for the price.

With the price? ""Eek! Methinks not."" One star.",0,Hvzpm8N2Vk79c97qwcr75Q

For my main, I had the scallops, which were perfectly prepared with a bacon sauce. The portions are not large here, so I had room for dessert.

I repeatedly told him in email and in person that I wanted 10% down with two loans. What does he ask me one month before the closing? Did you want to put 20% down or get two loans? WOW. 


They take forever to process the paperwork and David is too busy to pay attention to my needs. I told him at the beginning of March, I only want to pay 10% down otherwise I'm going with another lender. I told him to give me a worksheet for two loans. 1.5 month later, he gives me the worksheet for two loans. I even told him in person, 10% and two loans. End of May, he wants to confirm whether I wanted 20% down or two loans. 

Day before the scheduled signing, if I hadn't called American West to confirm the signing, I would've have even known that the loan docs were not approved!!! Then I hear from AW that the reason why there is no signing is because I changed my mind and said I wanted two loans. 

Not only is he incapable of managing his workload and providing decent service, he is a liar as well. They also deducted hundreds from my lender credit because of the loan rate lock extension (required because he took too long!), he didn't even call me to address my concerns. I told his agent that he doesn't need to call me if he's not going to give me my money back, and he never called.

For most of the meal, it was an excellent decision.  Unlike many others, I found the seating process and the waiter to be friendly and attentive.

We decided not to have an appetizer and save ourselves for dessert.   BTW they have an excellent wine list and we ordered a decently priced Pomerol.  Also, we ordered the Rib Chop for two, mid rare, and sides of fingerling potatoes and carrots along with a demi sauce.

The wine was awesome.  The Rib Chop was cooked perfectly and one of the best steaks I've ever had.  The potatoes were cooked with duck fat and were delicious.   For some reason, instead of carrots we received beets, but they were excellent.   The Demi never arrived and we didn't ask for it as we didn't want to wait on it.   All was fine as the food was so great!   But these small flaws could cause others not to enjoy themselves.

So why the low rating?   The dessert.   We ordered a chocolate brownie with peanut butter topping.   The whipped peanut topping was great but the brownie was disgusting.   There was nothing brownie about it.  And not much chocolate about it either.   My wife took one bite and decided it was undercooked.   I marshaled on not wanting to give up as I rarely leave a chocolate crumb.   Made it half way.   The 'brownie' was three dense disks that tasted like bad, uncooked, almost tasteless dough.  If the owner or chef had ever tasted this item it would not be on the menu.   First dessert I've ever been disgusted by.    Terrible end to an otherwise great dinner.",0,C8Iv-bdayhA_YXWIBLVjmQ

As well, like all the other average Viet restos in Calgary, Bolsa doesn't serve shaken (cubed) beef stew, spiced chicken, specialty fried rices, and many other standard Vietnamese dishes. 

Although others wrote good things about Bolsa, It's obvious that the standard of excellence set in Asia - truly genuine street food - is not striven for by most Viet restos here in Calgary.
Unfortunate for them, a close match IS found only at Pure Contemporary Vietnamese Kitchen on 8th Avenue downtown! 
As a chef isn't a short-order cook, most Viet restos either don't put in the effort, or don't have the skills! In their own country, it's likely this place would not survive.

Therefore their 'pho bun hoe' or 'spicey sate pho' was only so-so. The flavours were missing because the spices that Momma uses clearly don't cut it. 
The mixture of meats - beef and two kinds of pork sausages - were good, but the 'round' noodles were overcooked, and not at all close in quality or flavour to authentic Vietnam or even Italian noodles. 
The underwhelming broth was quite disappointing.

But the Indo-Chinese music was excellent, and for sure adds to the atmosphere there!

I was told to lightly exfoliate every day after 48 hrs. I have kept to this regiment. I have one particular bump that is a little swollen and is sensitive and a little sore. I came in to just have an aesthetician look at it to see if it was an ingrown hair or a normal post waxing reaction. I was told I would have to pay for a visit, and I was also told that they don't know anything about skin and that I'd have to see a doctor if I wanted an opinion on that. I was also told that I could make an appointment 4 days from now, and that the aesthetician would look at it but couldn't tell me what it is or may be, but that she could recommend some skin care products for me to buy from their store.

La Tamalera did not disappoint.

We had a chicken tamale, Tacos de cochinita, and Tacos al pastor.

The tamale was ok. A little heavy on the dough and light on the chicken. I don't have a lot of tamale experience though. Maybe it's meant to be that way? The spicy sauce served with the tamale was green with red pepper flecks throughout. Spicy and good!

The cochinita was swimming in an amazing braised broth as topped with pickled onions.   We were fighting over this one.

The al pastor tacos were a little dry but had a great flavor and were topped with cilantro and fresh cut pineapple. No canned pineapple here! 

At the end of the meal I inquired about desert and, lucky me, a decadent Tres leche cake was on the menu. It was beautifully plated, fresh, and not too sweet.

My first impression is that it reminded me of a co-op that I used to frequent while living in Florida. I appreciate the philosophical origin of what food should be instead of the chemical concoctions in most mainstream grocery stores. I thought that the fruit and vegetable section was kind of small but excused this away by telling myself that this is a new store and once they see what the volume is, they will build up this section. I had the same thought about the paltry meat section.

My favorite part of the store was the grains section. There is ample selection of pre-bagged grains and hard to find to food items. I picked up a pound of Maple Almond Granola for 3 bucks. I also found a new item that I would find useful in my last minute meal prep: Bottled organic salt-free strained tomatoes (great for making soups and sauces). There was also a large selection of flours for your health conscious pleasures. The refrigerated food section had a large selection of gluten-free items. I remember thinking, ""I like gluten. If it wasn't gluten free, I'd probably try it.""

There was also a large presence of lotions and soaps next to the large vitamin area. They even had multi-vitamins tailored to teen boys and teen girls; which I also bought for my teenager. I opened the bottle and they were vegan and smelled horrible. These particular vitamins included everything but the kitchen sink but I don't honestly believe that I will be able to get my kid to swallow even one of those horse pills. 

While I was perusing the aisles, I heard a young girl complaining to her mom about, ""where are the lucky charms?"" Once, the newness wears off, it will be the diehard health-conscious who will keep this store afloat in our deficient part of the county. My tip is that Natural Grocers like for you to bring your own bag. Last, this is a good store for those with deep pockets or small families.",9,MwpK7PqQX7fgTFM2Pfy61w

We planned a group dinner here for a special reunion. We had a few issues making reservations online for a party of 9, but calling in resolved the issue quickly. Due to some last minute cancellations in our group, only seven of us were able to attend, and the hostess reacted negatively to the change in party size. 

We ordered one dish each but intended to eat family style, so when the waiters took away the sharing plates, we asked to have them back. The wait staff did not attempt to hide their eye rolls and exasperation. We were presented with similar condescending reactions throughout the night, from ordering drinks to paying the bill. Our group consisted of introverted academics, so I cannot think of anything in our behavior or etiquette that would have warranted this kind of reaction, other than not ordering more food and drinks than we wanted so they could make a bigger tip.

The dishes themselves were quite tasty and artfully prepared but nothing to write home about. The wide spread in cuisines made for a fun smorgasbord of items, but as usual with tapas, portion size is a bit lacking given the price. Some dishes were sloppy in presentation-- the Bangkok beef salad was served in a puddle of dressing, and the calamari lost its crunch in the sauce. My favorite was the Bufala mozzarella and pear crostinis.

I normally don't complain about service, but the rudeness of the staff cast a pall over what should have been a joyous event. By the end of the night, the member of our party who suggested Origin was apologizing to everyone profusely for ruining the night, but the blame for that lies squarely on Origin's waitstaff.

I will start with the food. I haven't been disappointed with the flavors. Everything has been good. Portions are a bit small as many others have mentioned. My main issue comes from the 1st and second time I ordered food via delivery rather than going into the restaurant itself. The first time they delivered, it was a $2 delivery charge. They are literally 2 miles away from my apartment. 6 minute drive. The second time, without notice.. the delivery fee jumped to $7. A significant increase. 

I really liked the food enough to order food from them.. Unfortunately, It's enough to never order delivery from them again - with that steep delivery charge.  Doesn't seem worth it. I'd rather drive there.. but it seems a bit shady, so I'm not feeling good about supporting them again. Sounds petty, but it's the principle of the matter I suppose.

Just like any other keg, it was packed, and we waited almost 45 mins to be seated. The area was very dim and it sets the mood for a romantic night out. 

 I opted for my favorite filet mignon and ordered a Forbidden Fruit martini. The drink was really good; I especially liked the strawberry rock crystals along the rim on the drink. I would recommend this drink for girls, even those who do not regularly drink alcohol because the taste of vodka is barely there. 

Onto the filet mignon. I asked for medium rare, but when it came, it was more on the rare side. What's special about the steak was that it was wrapped by a piece of bacon. However, I prefer the steak on its own. The taste of the bacon took over, so halfway through the meal, I separated the two. The steak on its own was very juicy and soft. 

Just a tip - the roasted garlic mashed potato side is MASSIVE. Compared to the twice baked potato, the portion is almost double the size! So.. finish your steak before your side.

The service, like any other Keg, was great. The waiter was friendly and attentive.

The options are endless and you can most certainly update your wardrobe at a very reasonable value. I had never used a tailor before but the process was not intimidating at all. I told Peter what I was looking for, the budget I had to spend and he walked me through several options. Their customer service was top-notch. Peter was patient with me, showed me several options, and provided his advice. The process was not intimidating at all and I walked away with 2 perfect suits.

After buying most of my suits and work clothes from Nordstrom or Jos A Bank I FINALLY took the advice of my good friend and clothier/tailor, Peter. I always hesitated coming in because I assumed the price range was out of my budget. Brothers Tailors has so many options: suits off the rack, custom suits, bespoke suits.

When I asked whether a salad was served with an entree, he said if I looked at the menu, it would specify whether or not a salad was included. I was quite offended by his tone. At no point during our visit did we receive a smile or any gesture that would make us want to return.

Ok so I forgot the name of the meal I ordered but do remember what the meal contained: Eggs, 2 sausage links, hash brown, toast, and 2 pancakes. I can tell you that the food looked better than it actually tasted. I mean the food wasn't nasty but I've had better. 

The eggs were bland and didn't have any real taste to them, so I had to put some salt on them (Not a good idea if you have high blood pressure). The toast was actually good, it was nice and buttery. The 2 sausage links and the hash brown were ok I didn't have any issues with them.  Finally the pancakes, although they were pretty sizable and looked very good they really didn't have any real taste just a lot of fluff.

Beyond the beat down appearance and rough exterior lies an Asian grocery store that can satisfy your basic needs for Asian cooking.  The owners are great and very friendly and you can count on good suggestions and even a little cultural history on Vietnamese cuisine.  Aside from the groceries that are present with your can goods, spices, fresh Asian vegetables, and your selection of meats and seafood, what should draw you in is the small display of cooked and prepared foods in the back.  When ready and fresh are delicious and convenient to buy and take home to eat for dinner which will save you the time to prepare these Vietnamese dishes.  For me the hidden gem of Phoenix and Arizona is there Banh Bao.  This is a steamed Asian pastry filled with barbeque and steam pork with quarter of a hard boiled egg.  When eaten fresh out of the oven, the ingredients melt in your mouth combining the sweetness of the dough mixed with the savoriness of the pork meat.  I only wish this was made daily.",1,EzOF8RLzbcsA9EwMYlUfsg

I felt cheated (especially since I had a much better lobster roll w/ fries at the CNE for $5 less). My fiancÃ© had the crab legs and shrimp combo and he liked it but the portions, once again, didn't seem to correspond with the price. My friend had the bisque soup and I honestly don't understand that dish. Maybe it caters to a certain type of foodie but having your soup taste like coffee just threw us off.

I was immediately greeted by a staff when I went inside. There was a flyer that just came out today. I noticed Henckle knives set was $99 !!! not bad. Original nearly $200.

But customer service is terrible and MAYBE not because of the server's fault.  It's the store policy!

My daughter, her friend, and I went into the store to buy ice cream cones.  The server takes our order and hands the cone to my daughter and her friend.  Well, the scoop of ice cream falls out of the cone and onto the floor.  We made it a point to tell the server the ice cream just fell right out without tipping the cone.  He replied the rehearsed line, ""it's our policy not to replace the ice cream."".....REALLY?.....  And this after you didn't smush it down into the cone hard enough so it could stay put or that the little girl didn't tip the cone over? (she's 9)  So I had to shell out another $3.75 to replace the cone.

I think the goodwill shown by replacing the ice cream scoop for free is better than having to charge the customer more money for something that wasn't even the girl's fault.  I don't fault the server  (he's following orders from the owners) but taking good care of your customers is worth a lot more than an extra $3.75. You can always make an exception, especially when it's a young child. How can you tell a child who drops their ice cream ( clean drop, no licks yet) that they can't have a replacement?",4,pTocAMWg153r7ORGWmxSFg

I've gone to see Layla two times now and I'm thrilled with my lashes.  The first time I went in we opted for a ""natural"" look.  I left looking like me but way better! As a first time lash wearer I was super paranoid and had tons of questions for Layla.  She answered every question I had at the appointment and responded to text questions quickly! My initial appointment lasted two hours, which seems like a long time but Layla made the experience go very quickly, she plays great soothing music, and explains her process step by step.  I'm a pretty high energy, bouncy person so laying still with my eyes closed is a challenge for me but somehow Layla creates the perfect environment to just chill out in.  After having your lashes applied you have to go 24 hours without getting your face wet, that means no shower but a bath is ok.  Also if you're a person who sleeps on their side or face a contoured sleep mask is a good investment to protect your lashes.  I had my fill in appointment exactly three weeks after my initial application.  My lashes still looked pretty good, but there were definately some gaps and I was feeling the urge to use mascara to blend everything in (a big no no). The fill took about an hour and we went a little longer and fuller this time.  Once again the experience was great!

I'd splurge there again, for sure. I think I might go back on an off night next time, though - not because of the noise (it was very loud BUT they were playing great music all eve) - just simply to avoid choking on so much cologne/perfume while trying to eat, and, you know, breathe. The crowd was putting on all the chemical romance the last time I was in - gotta love a Montreal Friday night.",3,VkWUgLZkholyRWagwDpgHw

- Original/creative/delicious cocktail creations
- Fair pricing (costs me the same as a beer at an Irish pub)
- TV/Fooseball
- Long tables mean no messing around with bistro tables and chairs when you're a big group (had my bday there).
- Waitresses do their best despite the chaos and have always been pleasant
- Next door to Banquise AND you can bring your food in as long as your drinking (be respectful and don't lounge for hours on a shot)
- Awesome art nouveau decor fits the scene perfectly

TIP:
8- 9pm is when you can sit, have drinks and maybe catch the tail end of a happy hour and wait for the line at banquise to go down
10:30 - 12 is when it's most packed especially on hockey nights. Drink with the best of them or duck out to Banquise when the line is long",4,dPw3YdhvbdY7wVL6N_Y6yw

I discovered Thai Tea at a Farmer's Market a few months ago, and haven't been able to get enough of this stuff since. Same thing for boba, except at first I didn't care for it but now I crave that shit like it's crack or something. 

After a failed attempt to go to our usual boba spot, a Yelp search revealed that China A Go Go sells boba! Worth a shot, right? I called ahead to make sure they were open (it was 9PM) and the girl who answered was nice enough. I ended going up with the Thai Tea and my husband got a Taro slushie. Unfortunately for us, they were out of boba. Boba is half the fun! We were pretty disappointed.

THIA TEA ($3): I've never had a bad Thai Tea. Sure, I like some better than others but I was content with the tea here. I though it was weird that they used Coffee-Mate creamer in the tea, though.
TARO TEA ($3): The employee made this from scratch. We watched in fascination as she got the ice, water, sugar, and scoops of taro and blended it into a giant slushie. We got the idea that maybe we could make Taro slushies at home! Anyone know where to buy some Taro powder?

P.S. I've had takeout a few times here in the distant past. Foods 'aight. I've only tried the vegetable chow mein and spring rolls. 

Worth a Return Visit?
Next time, I'll call to confirm that they have boba on hand. My tea drinks simply aren't complete without boba.

I have been to several burger joints in the GTA and this being my 2nd visit to a BP location and I always love their burgers the best! 

I'm not one for a regular burger, so BP does good for me on their unusual styles of burger-ing. 

This was our last CMYE Burger Brigade event of 2014 and it gave a delicious ending to the year of burger eating.

I ordered Noah's Ark
- The Option veggie burger with chili and cheese between hamburger buns. 
Now The Option in itself was the winner here (A custom blend of cheesy goodness sandwiched between Two Roasted portabello mushrooms, breaded and deep fried)
Paired with the chili and the ""works"" toppings! Muah! finger licking good!

I have had similar style ""option"" burgers at other places but BP does it best! The portabello mushrooms are tender and juicy and the breading gives a nice crunch.. Then the cheese.... oooey gooooey cheesy goodness oozing from the middle! 

I tried the fries and chili fries but I just couldn't get my mind off the burger.

I will definitely come back again and board Noah's Ark more than once!
